INTRODUCTION

My Grand Narrative

W hat  I  call  the  “long  twentieth  century”  started  with  

the watershed-crossing events of around 1870—the tri-
ple emergence of globalization, the industrial research lab, and 
the modern corporation—which ushered in changes that began 
to pull the world out of the dire poverty that had been humani-
ty’s lot for the previous ten thousand years, since the discovery of 
agriculture.1 And what I call the “long twentieth century” ended 
in 2010, with the world’s leading economic edge, the countries 
of the North Atlantic, still reeling from the Great Recession that 
had begun in 2008, and thereafter unable to resume economic 
growth at anything near the average pace that had been the rule 
since  1870.  The  years  following  were  to  bring  large  system- 
destabilizing waves of political and cultural anger from masses 
of citizens, all upset in different ways and for different reasons 
at the failure of the system of the twentieth century to work for 
them as they thought that it should.

In between, things were marvelous and terrible, but by the 
standards of all of the rest of human history much more marvel-
ous than terrible. The 140 years from 1870 to 2010 of the long 
twentieth century were, I strongly believe, the most consequen-
tial years of all humanity’s centuries. And it was the first century

in which the most important historical thread was what anyone 
would call the economic one, for it was the century that saw us 
end our near-universal dire material poverty.

My strong belief that history should focus on the long twen-
tieth century stands in contrast to what others—most notably the 
Marxist British historian Eric Hobsbawm—have focused on and 
called the “short twentieth century,” which lasted from the start 
of World War I in 1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.2 
Such others tend to see the nineteenth century as the long rise 
of democracy and capitalism, from 1776 to 1914, and the short 
twentieth century as one in which really-existing socialism and 
fascism shake the world.

Histories of centuries, long or short, are by definition grand 
narrative  histories,  built  to  tell  the  author’s  desired  story.  Set-
ting these years, 1914–1991, apart as a century makes it easy for 
Hobsbawm to tell the story he wants to tell. But it does so at the 
price of missing much of what I strongly believe is the bigger, 
more important story. It is the one that runs from about 1870 
to 2010, from humanity’s success in unlocking the gate that had 
kept it in dire poverty up to its failure to maintain the pace of the 
rapid upward trajectory in human wealth that the earlier success 
had set in motion.3

What follows is my grand narrative, my version of what is the 
most important story to tell of the history of the twentieth cen-
tury. It is a primarily economic story. It naturally starts in 1870. 
I believe it naturally stops in 2010.

As  the  genius,  Dr.  Jekyll–like,  Austro-English-Chicagoan 
moral  philosopher  Friedrich  August  von  Hayek  observed,  the 
market economy crowdsources—incentivizes and coordinates at 
the  grassroots—solutions  to  the  problems  it  sets.4  Back  before 
1870 humanity did not have the technologies or the organiza-
tions to allow a market economy to pose the problem of how to 
make the economy rich. So even though humanity had had mar-
ket economies, or at least market sectors within its economies, for

thousands of years before 1870, all that markets could do was to 
find customers for producers of luxuries and conveniences, and 
make the lives of the rich luxurious and of the middle class con-
venient and comfortable.

Things changed starting around 1870. Then we got the in-
stitutions for organization and research and the technologies— 
we got full globalization, the industrial research laboratory, and 
the modern corporation. These were the keys. These unlocked 
the gate that had previously kept humanity in dire poverty. The 
problem  of  making  humanity  rich  could  now  be  posed  to  the 
market economy, because it now had a solution. On the other 
side of the gate, the trail to utopia came into view. And every-
thing else good should have followed from that.

Much good did follow from that.
My estimate—or perhaps my very crude personal guess—of 
the average worldwide pace of what is at the core of humanity’s 
economic growth, the proportional rate of growth of my index of 
the value of the stock of useful ideas about manipulating nature 
and organizing humans that were discovered, developed, and de-
ployed into the world economy, shot up from about 0.45 percent 
per year before 1870 to 2.1 percent per year afterward, truly a 
watershed  boundary-crossing  difference.  A  2.1  percent  average 
growth for the 140 years from 1870 to 2010 is a multiplication 
by a factor of 21.5. That was very good: the growing power to 
create wealth and earn an income allowed humans to have more 
of the good things, the necessities, conveniences, and luxuries of 
life, and to better provide for themselves and their families. This 
does not mean that humanity in 2010 was 21.5 times as rich in 
material-welfare terms as it had been in 1870: there were six times 
as many people in 2010 as there were in 1870, and the resulting 
increase in resource scarcity would take away from human living 
standards and labor-productivity levels. As a rough guess, aver-
age world income per capita in 2010 would be 8.8 times what it 
was in 1870, meaning an average income per capita in 2010 of

perhaps $11,000 per year. (To get the figure of 8.8, you divide 
21.5 by the square root of 6.) Hold these figures in your head as a 
very rough guide to the amount by which humanity was richer in 
2010 than it was in 1870—and never forget that the riches were 
vastly more unequally distributed around the globe in 2010 than 
they were in 1870.5

A 2.1 percent per year growth rate is a doubling every thirty- 
three years. That meant that the technological and productivity 
economic  underpinnings  of  human  society  in  1903  were  pro-
foundly different from those of 1870—underpinnings of industry 
and globalization as opposed to agrarian and landlord dominated. 
The mass-production underpinnings of 1936, at least in the in-
dustrial core of the global north, were profoundly different also. 
But  the  change  to  the  mass  consumption  and  suburbanization 
underpinnings of 1969 was as profound, and that was followed by 
the shift to the information-age microelectronic- based underpin-
nings of 2002. A revolutionized economy every generation cannot 
but revolutionize society and politics, and a government trying to 
cope with such repeated revolutions cannot help but be greatly 
stressed in its attempts to manage and provide for its people in 
the storms.

Much  good,  but  much  ill,  also  flowed:  people  can  and  do 
use technologies—both the harder ones, for manipulating nature, 
and the softer ones, for organizing humans—to exploit, to dom-
inate, and to tyrannize. And the long twentieth century saw the 
worst and most bloodthirsty tyrannies that we know of.

And  much  that  was  mixed,  both  for  good  and  for  ill,  also 
flowed. All that was solid melted into air—or rather, all estab-
lished orders and patterns were steamed away.6 Only a small pro-
portion of economic life could be carried out, and was carried 
out, in 2010 the same way it had been in 1870. And even the 
portion that was the same was different: even if you were doing 
the same tasks that your predecessors had done back in 1870, and 
doing them in the same places, others would pay much less of the

worth of their labor-time for what you did or made. As nearly 
everything economic was transformed and transformed again—as 
the economy was revolutionized in every generation, at least in 
those places on the earth that were lucky enough to be the growth 
poles—those changes shaped and transformed nearly everything 
sociological, political, and cultural.

Suppose we could go back in time to 1870, and tell people 
then  how  rich,  relative  to  them,  humanity  would  become  by 
2010. How would they have reacted? They would almost surely 
have thought that the world of 2010 would be a paradise, a uto-
pia. People would have 8.8 times the wealth? Surely that would 
mean enough power to manipulate nature and organize humans 
that all but the most trivial of problems and obstacles hobbling 
humanity could be resolved.

But not so. It has now been 150 years. We did not run to the 
trail’s  end  and  reach  utopia.  We  are  still  on  the  trail—maybe, 
for we can no longer see clearly to the end of the trail or even to 
wherever the trail we are on is going to lead.

What went wrong?
Well, Hayek may have been a genius, but only the Dr. Jekyll 
side of him was a genius. He and his followers were extraordinary 
idiots as well. They also thought the market alone could do the 
whole job—or at least all the job that could be done—and com-
manded humanity to believe in the workings of a system with a 
logic of its own that mere humans could never fully understand: 
“The market giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be the name 
of the market.” They thought that what salvation was possible for 
humanity would come not through St. Paul of Tarsus’s solo fide 
but through Hayek’s solo mercato.7

But  humanity  objected.  The  market  economy  solved  the 
problems that it set itself, but then society did not want those 
solutions—it wanted solutions to other problems, problems that 
the market economy did not set itself, and for which the crowd-
sourced solutions it offered were inadequate.

It was, perhaps, Hungarian-Jewish-Torontonian moral phi-
losopher Karl Polanyi who best described the issue. The market 
economy recognizes property rights. It sets itself the problem of 
giving those who own property—or, rather, the pieces of prop-
erty that it decides are valuable—what they think they want. If 
you have no property, you have no rights. And if the property you 
have is not valuable, the rights you have are very thin.

But  people  think  they  have  other  rights—they  think  that 
those who do not own valuable property should have the social 
power to be listened to, and that societies should take their needs 
and  desires  into  account.8  Now  the  market  economy  might  in 
fact satisfy their needs and desires. But if it does so, it does so 
only by accident: only if satisfying them happens to conform to a 
maximum-profitability test performed by a market economy that 
is solving the problem of getting the owners of valuable pieces of 
property as much of what the rich want as possible.9

So throughout the long twentieth century, communities and 
people looked at what the market economy was delivering to them 
and said: “Did we order that?” And society demanded something 
else. The idiot Mr. Hyde side of Friedrich von Hayek called it 
“social justice,” and decreed that people should forget about it: 
the market economy could never deliver social justice, and to try 
to rejigger society so that social justice could be delivered would 
destroy the market economy’s ability to deliver what it could de-
liver—increasing wealth, distributed to those who owned valu-
able property rights.10

Do note that in this context “social justice” was always only 
“justice” relative to what particular groups desired: not anything 
justified by any consensus transcendental principles. Do note that 
it was rarely egalitarian: it is unjust if those unequal to you are 
treated equally. But the only conception of “justice” that the mar-
ket economy could deliver was what the rich might think was just, 
for the property owners were the only people it cared for. Plus, 
the market economy, while powerful, is not perfect: it cannot by

itself deliver enough research and development, for example, or 
environmental quality, or, indeed, full and stable employment.11
No: “The market giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be 
the name of the market” was not a stable principle around which 
to organize society and political economy. The only stable prin-
ciple had to be some version of “The market was made for man, 
not man for the market.” But who were the men who counted, 
for whom the market should be made? And what version would 
be the best making? And how to resolve the squabbles over the 
answers to those questions?

Throughout the long twentieth century, many others—Karl 
Polanyi, John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, and Vladimir 
Lenin serve as good markers for many of the currents of thought, 
activism,  and  action—tried  to  think  up  solutions.  They  dis-
sented from the pseudo-classical (for the order of society, econ-
omy, and polity as it stood in the years after 1870 was in fact 
quite new), semi-liberal (for it rested upon ascribed and inherited 
authority as much as on freedom) order that Hayek and his ilk 
advocated and worked to create and maintain. They did so con-
structively and destructively, demanding that the market do less, 
or do something different, and that other institutions do more. 
Perhaps the closest humanity got was the shotgun marriage of 
Hayek and Polanyi blessed by Keynes in the form of post–World 
War II North Atlantic developmental social democracy. But that 
institutional setup failed its own sustainability test. And so we are 
still on the path, not at its end. And we are still, at best, slouching 
toward utopia.

RETURN TO MY CLAIM above that the long twentieth century was 
the first century in which the most important historical thread 
was the economic one. That is a claim worth pausing over. The 
century saw, among much else, two world wars, the Holocaust, 
the  rise  and  fall  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  zenith  of  American

influence, and the rise of communist China. How dare I say that 
these are all aspects of one primarily economic story? Indeed, how 
dare I say that there is one single most consequential thread?

I do so because we have to tell grand narratives if we are to 
think at all. Grand narratives are, in the words of that bellwether 
twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, “nonsense.” 
But,  in  a  sense,  all  human  thought  is  nonsense:  fuzzy,  prone 
to  confusions,  and  capable  of  leading  us  astray.  And  our  fuzzy 
thoughts are the only ways we can think—the only ways we have 
to  progress.  If  we  are  lucky,  Wittgenstein  said,  we  can  “recog-
nize . . . them as nonsensical,” and use them as steps “to climb be-
yond them . . . [and then] throw away the ladder”—for, perhaps, 
we will have learned to transcend “these propositions” and gained 
the ability to “see the world aright.”12

It  is  in  hopes  of  transcending  the  nonsense  to  glimpse  the 
world aright that I’ve written this grand narrative. It is in that 
spirit  that  I  declare  unhesitatingly  that  the  most  consequent 
thread through all this history was economic.

Before 1870, over and over again, technology lost its race with 
human fecundity, with the speed at which we reproduce. Greater 
numbers, coupled with resource scarcity and a slow pace of tech-
nological innovation, produced a situation in which most people, 
most of the time, could not be confident that in a year they and 
their family members would have enough to eat and a roof over 
their heads.13 Before 1870, those able to attain such comforts had 
to do so by taking from others, rather than by finding ways to 
make more for everyone (especially because those specializing in 
producing, rather than taking, thereby become very soft and at-
tractive targets to the specializers in taking).

The ice was breaking before 1870. Between 1770 and 1870 
technology and organization gained a step or two on fecundity. 
But only a step or two. In the early 1870s that British establish-
ment economist, moral philosopher, and bureaucrat John Stuart

Mill claimed, with some justification, that “it is questionable if all 
the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day’s toil 
of any human being.”14 You have to go forward a generation after 
1870 before general material progress becomes unquestionable. 
The  ice  could  then  have  resolidified—the  nineteenth-century 
technologies of steam, iron, rails, and textiles were approaching 
their culmination point; moreover, they all depended on hyper- 
cheap coal, and the hyper-cheap coal was being exhausted.

But tell anyone from before the long twentieth century about 
the wealth, productivity, technology, and sophisticated produc-
tive organizations of the world today, and their likely response, 
as noted above, would be that with such enormous power and 
wealth in our collective hands we must have built a utopia.

That is in fact what they did tell us. Perhaps the third best- 
selling novel in the United States in the nineteenth century was 
Looking Backward, 2000–1887, by Edward Bellamy. Bellamy was 
a populist and—although he rejected the name—a socialist: he 
dreamed of a utopia created by government ownership of indus-
try, the elimination of destructive competition, and the altruistic 
mobilization  of  human  energies.  Technological  and  organiza-
tional abundance, he believed, would generate a society of abun-
dance. His novel, therefore, was a “literary fantasy, a fairy tale of 
social felicity,” in which he imagined “hanging in mid-air, far out 
of reach of the sordid and material world of the present . . . [a] 
cloud-palace for an ideal humanity.”15

He  throws  his  narrator-protagonist  forward  in  time,  from 
1887 to 2000, to marvel at a rich, well-functioning society. At 
one  point  the  narrator-protagonist  is  asked  if  he  would  like  to 
hear some music. He expects his hostess to play the piano. This 
alone would be testament to a vast leap forward. To listen to mu-
sic on demand in around 1900 you had to have—in your house or 
nearby—an instrument, and someone trained to play it. It would 
have cost the average worker some 2,400 hours, roughly a year

at a 50-hour workweek, to earn the money to buy a high-quality 
piano. Then there would be the expense and the time committed 
to piano lessons.

But Bellamy’s narrator-protagonist is awed when his hostess 
does not sit down at the pianoforte to amuse him. Instead, she 
“merely touched one or two screws,” and immediately the room 
was “filled with music; filled, not flooded, for, by some means, 
the volume of melody had been perfectly graduated to the size of 
the apartment. ‘Grand!’ I cried. ‘Bach must be at the keys of that 
organ; but where is the organ?’”

He learns that his host has dialed up, on her telephone land-
line, a live orchestra, and she has put it on the speakerphone. In 
Bellamy’s utopia, you see, you can dial up a local orchestra and 
listen to it play live. But wait. It gets more impressive. He further 
learns he has a choice. His hostess could dial up one of four or-
chestras currently playing.

The narrator’s reaction? “If we [in the 1800s] could have de-
vised an arrangement for providing everybody with music in their 
homes, perfect in quality, unlimited in quantity, suited to every 
mood, and beginning and ceasing at will, we should have consid-
ered the limit of human felicity already attained.”16 Think of that: 
the limit of human felicity.

Utopias are, by definition, the end-all and be-all. “An imag-
ined place or state of things in which everyone is perfect”: so says 
Oxford Reference.17 Much of human history has been spent in 
disastrous flirtations with ideals of perfection of many varieties. 
Utopian imaginings during the long twentieth century were re-
sponsible for its most shocking grotesqueries.

Citing a quotation from the eighteenth-century philosopher 
Immanuel Kant—“Out of the crooked timber of humanity no 
straight thing was ever made”—the philosopher-historian Isaiah 
Berlin concluded, “And for that reason no perfect solution is, not 
merely in practice, but in principle, possible in human affairs.”18

Berlin went on to write, “Any determined attempt to produce 
it is likely to lead to suffering, disillusionment, and failure.” This 
observation also points to why I see the long twentieth century 
as most fundamentally economic. For all its uneven benefits, for 
all its expanding human felicity without ever reaching its limit, 
for all its manifest imperfections, economics during the twentieth 
century has worked just shy of miracles.

The consequences of the long twentieth century have been 
enormous: Today, less than 9 percent of humanity lives at or be-
low the roughly $2-a-day living standard we think of as “extreme 
poverty,” down from approximately 70 percent in 1870. And even 
among that 9 percent, many have access to public health and mo-
bile phone communication technologies of vast worth and power. 
Today, the luckier economies of the world have achieved levels 
of per capita prosperity at least twenty times those of 1870, and 
at least twenty-five times those of 1770—and there is every rea-
son to believe prosperity will continue to grow at an exponential 
rate in the centuries to come. Today, the typical citizens of these 
economies can wield powers—of mobility, of communication, of 
creation, and of destruction—that approach those attributed to 
sorcerers and gods in ages past. Even the majority of those living 
in unlucky economies and in the “global south” confront not the 
$2- to $3-a-day living standard of those economies in 1800 or 
1870, but an average closer to $15 a day.

Many technological inventions of the past century have trans-
formed experiences that were rare and valued luxuries—available 
only to a rich few at great expense—into features of modern life 
that we take so much for granted that they would not make the 
top  twenty  or  even  the  top  one  hundred  in  an  ordered  list  of 
what we think our wealth consists of. So many of us have grown 
so accustomed to our daily level of felicity that we utterly over-
look something astounding. We today—even the richest of us—
rarely see ourselves as so extraordinarily lucky and fortunate and

happy, even though, for the first time in human history, there is 
more than enough.

There are more than enough calories produced in the world, 

so it is not necessary for anybody to be hungry.

There is more than enough shelter on the globe, so it is not 

necessary for anybody to be wet.

There is more than enough clothing in our warehouses, so it 

is not necessary for anybody to be cold.

And there is more than enough stuff lying around and be-
ing produced daily, so nobody need feel the lack of something 
necessary.

In short, we are no longer in anything that we could call “the 
realm of necessity.” And, as G. W. F. Hegel said, “Seek food and 
clothing first, and then the Kingdom of God shall be added unto 
you.”19 So, one would think, we humans ought to be in some-
thing recognizably utopian. That we cannot accept this is another 
consequence of living our lives fully in the stream of economic 
history. While history fueled by utopian aspirations is an all or 
nothing proposition, economic history’s successes and failures are 
most often experienced in the margins.

Which is partly why no full-throated triumphalism over the 
long twentieth century can survive even a brief look at the politi-
cal economy of the 2010s: the stepping-back of the United States 
from  its  role  of  good-guy  world  leader  and  of  Britain  from  its 
role as a key piece of Europe; and the rise in North America and 
Europe of political movements that reject democratic represen-
tative consensus politics—movements that former US secretary 
of state Madeleine Albright has called “fascist” (and who am I to 
tell her she is wrong?).20 Indeed, any triumphalist narrative would 
collapse in the face of the conspicuous failures over the previous 
decade by the stewards of the global economy.

Yes, during the years between 1870 and 2010, technology and 
organization repeatedly lapped fecundity. Yes, a newly richer hu-
manity resoundingly triumphed over tendencies for population to

expand and so for greater resource scarcity to offset more knowl-
edge and better technology. But material prosperity is unevenly 
distributed around the globe to a gross, even criminal, extent. And 
material  wealth  does  not  make  people  happy  in  a  world  where 
politicians and others prosper mightily from finding new ways to 
make and keep people unhappy. The history of the long twentieth 
century cannot be told as a triumphal gallop, or a march, or even 
a walk of progress along the road that brings us closer to utopia. It 
is, rather, a slouch. At best.

One reason why human progress toward utopia has been but 
a slouch is that so much of it has been and still is mediated by the 
market economy: that Mammon of Unrighteousness. The mar-
ket economy enables the astonishing coordination and coopera-
tion of by now nearly eight billion humans in a highly productive 
division of labor. The market economy also recognizes no rights 
of  humans  other  than  the  rights  that  come  with  the  property 
their governments say they possess. And those property rights are 
worth something only if they help produce things that the rich 
want to buy. That cannot be just.

As  I  noted  above,  Friedrich  von  Hayek  always  cautioned 
against  listening  to  the  siren  song  that  we  should  seek  justice 
rather  than  mere  productivity  and  abundance.  We  needed  to 
bind ourselves to the mast. Interference in the market, no mat-
ter how well intentioned when it started, would send us into a 
downward spiral. It would put us on a road to, well, some in-
dustrial-age variant of serfdom. But Karl Polanyi responded that 
such an attitude was inhuman and impossible: People firmly be-
lieved, above all else, that they had other rights more important 
than and prior to the property rights that energized the market 
economy. They had rights to a community that gave them sup-
port, to an income that gave them the resources they deserved, 
to economic stability that gave them consistent work. And when 
the market economy tried to dissolve all rights other than prop-
erty rights? Watch out!21

Slouching, however, is better than standing still, let alone go-
ing backward. That is a truism no generation of humanity has 
ever  disputed.  Humans  have  always  been  inventive.  Techno-
logical advance has rarely stopped. The windmills, dikes, fields, 
crops, and animals of Holland in 1700 made the economy of its 
countryside very different from the thinly farmed marshes of 700. 
The ships that docked at the Chinese port of Canton had much 
greater range and the commodities loaded on and off of them had 
much greater value in 1700 than in 800. And both commerce 
and agriculture in 800 were far more technologically advanced 
than they were in the first literate civilizations of 3000 BCE or so.
But before our age, back in the preindustrial Agrarian Age, 
technological progress led to little visible change over one or even 
several lifetimes, and little growth in typical living standards even 
over centuries or millennia.

Recall my very crude index that tracks the value of humanity’s 
useful ideas about manipulating nature and organizing collective 
efforts—an index of our “technology,” as economists call it. To 
calculate it, assume that each 1 percent increase in typical human 
standards of living worldwide tells us that the value of our useful 
ideas has risen by 1 percent. That is simply a normalization: I 
want the index to scale with real income, and not with something 
else, such as the square root of or the square of income. Also as-
sume that each 1 percent increase in the human population at a 
constant typical living standard tells us that the value of useful 
ideas has risen by 0.5 percent—for such an increase is necessary 
to hold living standards constant in the face of resource scarcities 
that emerge from a higher population. This is a way of taking ac-
count of the fact that, since our natural resources are not unlim-
ited, we depend on added human ingenuity to support a larger 
population at the same standard of living as we would depend on 
it to support the same population at a higher standard of living.22
Set this quantitative index of the global value of useful hu-
man knowledge equal to a value of 1 in 1870, at the start of the

long  twentieth  century.  Back  in  the  year  8000  BCE,  when  we 
discovered agriculture and developed herding, the index stood 
at 0.04: roughly, and on average across the globe, with the same 
materials and on the same size farms, it would take twenty-five 
workers in 8000 BCE to do what one worker could do in 1870. 
By the year 1, eight thousand years later, this index was 0.25: 
with  the  same  resources,  better  “technologies”  meant  that  the 
typical worker was now more than six times as productive as the 
typical worker had been back at the beginning of the Agrarian 
Age—but only one-quarter as productive as the typical worker 
of 1870. By the year 1500, the index stood at 0.43, more than 
70 percent above the year 1 and a little less than half the value 
of the year 1870.

These are impressive changes in an index number. They sum-
marize, from the standpoint of those who lived eight thousand 
years ago, truly miraculous and impressive enlargements of the 
human empire. Technologies of the year 1500, the Ming pottery 
or the Portuguese caravel or the wet cultivation of rice seedlings, 
would have seemed miraculous. But this growth, and the pace of 
invention, took place over an enormous span of time: technology 
crawled ahead at only 0.036 percent per year for the entire period 
between 1 and 1500—that is only 0.9 percent over an average 
twenty-five-year lifetime of that age.

And did greater knowledge about technology and human or-
ganization cause the life in 1500 of a typical person to be much 
sweeter  than  it  had  been  in  8000  BCE?  It  turns  out  not.  The 
human population grew at an average rate of 0.07 percent per 
year  from  year  1  to  1500,  and  this  0.07  percent  per  year  de-
crease in average farm size and other available natural resources 
per worker meant that more skillful work produced little, if any, 
additional net product on average. While the elite lived far better 
in 1500 than they had in 8000 BCE or the year 1, ordinary people 
—peasants  and  craftsmen—lived  little  or  no  better  than  their 
predecessors.

Agrarian Age humans were desperately poor: it was a subsis-
tence-level  society.  On  average,  2.03  children  per  mother  sur-
vived to reproduce. A typical woman (who was not among the 
one  in  seven  who  died  in  childbirth,  or  the  additional  one  in 
five who died before her children were grown, sometimes from 
the same contagious diseases to which her children succumbed) 
would have spent perhaps twenty years eating for two: she would 
have had perhaps nine pregnancies, six live births, and three or 
four children surviving to age five, and the life expectancy of her 
children remained under, and perhaps well under, thirty.23

Keeping your children from dying is the first and highest goal 
of every parent. Humanity in the Agrarian Age could not do so at 
all reliably. That is an index of how much pressure from material 
want humanity found itself under.

Over the millennia, 1.5 percent average population growth 
per generation added up, however. In 1500 there were about three 
times as many people as there had been in year 1—500 million 
rather than 170 million. Additional humans did not translate to 
less individual material want. As of 1500, advances in technolog-
ical and organizational knowledge went to compensate for fewer 
natural resources per capita. Thus economic history remained a 
slowly changing background in front of which cultural, political, 
and social history took place.

The ice started to groan and shift after 1500. Or perhaps a 
better metaphor is crossing a divide and entering a new water-
shed—you are now going downhill, and things are flowing in a 
new direction. Call this shift the coming of the age of the “Impe-
rial-Commercial Revolution.” The pace of inventions and inno-
vation sped up. And then, in around 1770, the ice was cracking 
as we crossed into yet a different watershed, as far as the level of 
worldwide  prosperity  and  the  pace  of  global  economic  growth 
was concerned: call the century after 1770 the coming of the age 
of the “Industrial Revolution.” By 1870 the index of the value of 
knowledge stood at 1, more than twice as large as in 1500. It had

taken 9,500 years to get the tenfold jump from 0.04 to 0.43—an 
average time-to-double of some 2,800 years—and then the next 
doubling took less than 370 years.

But did this mean a richer, more comfortable humanity in 
1870? Not very much. There were then in 1870 1.3 billion peo-
ple alive, 2.6 times as many as there had been in 1500. Farm sizes 
were only two-fifths as large, on average, as they had been in 1500, 
canceling out the overwhelming bulk of technological improve-
ment, as far as typical human living standards were concerned.

Around 1870 we crossed over another divide into yet another 
new watershed: the age Simon Kuznets called an era of “modern 
economic growth.”24 During the period that would follow, the 
long twentieth century, there came an explosion.

The  approximately  7  billion  people  in  2010  had  a  global 
value of knowledge index of 21. Pause to marvel. The value of 
knowledge about technology and organization had grown at an 
average rate of 2.1 percent per year. Since 1870, the technolog-
ical capability and material wealth of humankind had exploded 
beyond previous imagining. By 2010, the typical human family 
no longer faced as its most urgent and important problem the 
task of acquiring enough food, shelter, and clothing for the next 
year—or the next week.

From  the  techno-economic  point  of  view,  1870–2010  was 
the age of the industrial research lab and the bureaucratic cor-
poration. One gathered communities of engineering practice to 
super charge  economic  growth,  the  other  organized  communi-
ties of competence to deploy the fruits of invention. It was only 
slightly less the age of globalization: cheap ocean and rail trans-
port that destroyed distance as a cost factor and allowed humans 
in enormous numbers to seek better lives, along with communi-
cations links that allowed us to talk across the world in real time.
The  research  laboratory,  the  corporation,  and  globalization 
powered  the  wave  of  discovery,  invention,  innovation,  deploy-
ment, and global economic integration that have so boosted our

global  useful-economic-knowledge  index.  Marvel  still.  In  1870 
the daily wages of an unskilled male worker in London, the city 
then  at  the  forefront  of  world  economic  growth  and  develop-
ment, would buy him and his family about 5,000 calories worth 
of bread. That was progress: in 1800, his daily wages would have 
bought him and his family perhaps 4,000 coarser-bread calories, 
and in 1600, some 3,000 calories, coarser still. (But isn’t coarser, 
more fiber-heavy bread better for you? For us, yes—but only for 
those of us who are getting enough calories, and so have enough 
calories to give us the energy to do our daily work and then worry 
about things like fiber intake. In the old days, you were desperate 
to absorb as many calories as possible, and for that, whiter and 
finer bread was better.) Today, the daily wages of an unskilled 
male worker in London would buy him 2.4 million wheat calo-
ries: nearly five hundred times as much as in 1870.

From the bio-sociological point of view, this material progress 
meant that the typical woman no longer needed to spend twenty 
years eating for two—pregnant or breastfeeding. By 2010, it was 
more like four years. And it was also during this century that we 
became able, for the first time, to prevent more than half our ba-
bies from dying in miscarriages, stillbirths, and in infancy—and to 
prevent more than a tenth of mothers from dying in childbirth.25
From the nation-and-political point of view, the wealth cre-
ation and distribution drove four things, of which the first was 
by far the most important: 1870–2010 was the century when the 
United States became a superpower. Second, it was during this 
period that the world came to be composed primarily of nations 
rather than empires. Third, the economy’s center of gravity came 
to consist of large oligopolistic firms ringmastering value chains. 
Finally, it made a world in which political orders would be pri-
marily legitimated, at least notionally, by elections with universal 
suffrage—rather  than  the  claims  of  plutocracy,  tradition,  “fit-
ness,” leadership charisma, or knowledge of a secret key to his-
torical destiny.

My Grand Narrative

Much that our predecessors would have called “utopian” has 
been attained step by step, via economic improvements year by 
year, each of which is marginal, but which compound.

Yet, as of 1870, such an explosion was not foreseen, or not 
foreseen by many. Yes, 1770–1870 did see, for the first time, pro-
ductive capability begin to outrun population growth and natural 
resource scarcity. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, 
the average inhabitant of a leading economy—a Briton, a Bel-
gian, a Dutchman, an American, a Canadian, or an Australian— 
had perhaps twice the material wealth and standard of living of 
the typical inhabitant of a preindustrial economy.

Was that enough to be a true watershed?
Back in the early 1870s, John Stuart Mill put the finishing 
touches on the final edition of the book that people seeking to 
understand economics then looked to: Principles of Political Econ-
omy, with Some of Their Applications to Social Philosophy. His book 
gave due attention and place to the 1730–1870 era of the British 
Industrial Revolution. But he looked out on what he saw around 
him, and saw the world still poor and miserable. Far from light-
ening humanity’s daily toil, the era’s technology merely “enabled 
a greater population to live the same life of drudgery and impris-
onment, and an increased number of manufacturers and others  
to make fortunes.”26

One word of Mill’s stands out to me: “imprisonment.”
Yes, Mill saw a world with more and richer plutocrats and 
a larger middle class. But he also saw the world of 1871 as not 
just a world of drudgery—a world in which humans had to work 
long and tiring hours. He saw it not just as a world in which 
most people were close to the edge of being desperately hungry, 
not just a world of low literacy—where most could only access 
the collective human store of knowledge, ideas, and entertain-
ments partially and slowly. The world Mill saw was a world in 
which humanity was imprisoned: in a dungeon, chained and fet-
tered.27 And Mill saw only one way out: if the government were

to take control of human fecundity and require child licenses, 
prohibiting those who could not properly support and educate 
their children from reproducing, only then—or was he thinking 
“if”?—would mechanical inventions wreak the “great changes in 
human destiny, which it is in their nature and in their futurity 
to accomplish.”28

And there were others who were much more pessimistic than 
even Mill. In 1865, then thirty-year-old British economist Wil-
liam Stanley Jevons made his reputation by prophesying doom 
for the British economy: it needed to immediately cut back on 
industrial  production  in  order  to  economize  on  scarce  and  in-
creasingly valuable coal.29

With so much pessimism circulating, the coming explosion 
in economic growth was far from expected—but it would also be 
dangerously misconstrued by some.

Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels had in 1848 already seen sci-
ence and technology as Promethean forces that would allow hu-
manity to overthrow its (mythical) old gods and give humanity 
itself the power of a god. Science, technology, and the profit-seek-
ing entrepreneurial business class that deployed it had, they said,

during its rule of scarce one hundred years, . . . created more 
massive  and  more  colossal  productive  forces  than  have  all 
preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces 
to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and 
agriculture,  steam-navigation,  railways,  electric  telegraphs, 
clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of 
rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground—what 
earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive 
forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?30

ENGELS  SNARKED  THAT  IN  overlooking  the  power  of  science, 
technology, and engineering, mere economists (such as Mill) had

demonstrated that they were little more than the paid hacks of 
the rich.31

But  Marx  and  Engels’s  promise  was  not  that  there  would 
someday be enough to eat, or enough shelter, or enough clothing 
for the masses, let alone an exponential increase in the value of 
global knowledge, or even a nearly unlimited choice of music to 
listen to. Slouching, galloping economic growth was but a nec-
essary paroxysm on the way to utopia. Their promise was uto-
pia. In Marx’s few and thin descriptions of life after the socialist 
revolution, in works such as his Critique of the Gotha Program, 
the utopian life he foresaw echoed—deliberately, but with what 
authorial intent?—the descriptions in the Acts of the Apostles of 
how people who had attained the Kingdom of Heaven behaved: 
each contributed “according to his ability” (Acts 11:29), and each 
drew on the common, abundant store “according to his needs” 
(4:35).32 Perhaps he kept these descriptions rare and without de-
tail because they differed so little from what Mill envisioned: an 
end to the imprisonment and drudgery of poverty, a society in 
which all people could be truly free.

However, economic improvement, attained by slouch or gal-

lop, matters.

How many of us today could usefully find our way around a 
kitchen of a century ago? Before the coming of the electric cur-
rent and the automatic washing machine, doing the laundry was 
not  an  annoying,  minor  chore  but  instead  a  major  part  of  the 
household’s—or rather the household’s women’s—week. Today 
few  among  us  are  gatherers,  or  hunters,  or  farmers.  Hunting, 
gathering, farming, along with herding, spinning and weaving, 
cleaning,  digging,  smelting  metal,  and  shaping  wood—indeed, 
assembling  structures  by  hand—have  become  the  occupations 
of a small and dwindling proportion of humans. And where we 
do  have  farmers,  herdsmen,  manufacturing  workers,  construc-
tion workers, and miners, they are overwhelmingly controllers of

machines and increasingly programmers of robots. They are no 
longer people who manufacture, who make or shape things with 
their hands.

What do modern people do instead? Increasingly, we push 
forward the body of technological and scientific knowledge. We 
educate  each  other.  We  doctor  and  nurse  each  other.  We  care 
for our young and our old. We entertain each other. We provide 
other services for each other, so that we can all take advantage of 
the benefits of specialization. And we engage in complicated sym-
bolic  interactions  that  have  the  emergent  effect  of  distributing 
status and power and coordinating the division of labor of today’s 
economy that encompassed 7 billion people in 2010.

Over the course of the long century we have crossed a great 
divide, between what we used to do in all of previous human his-
tory and what we do now. Utopia, it is true, this is not. I imagine 
Bellamy would be at once impressed and disappointed.

The economic historian Richard Easterlin helps explain why. 
The history of the ends humans pursue, he suggests, demonstrates 
that we are ill suited for utopia. With our increasing wealth, what 
used to be necessities become matters of little concern—perhaps 
even beyond our notice. But conveniences turn into necessities. 
Luxuries turn into conveniences. And we humans envision and 
then create new luxuries.33

Easterlin,  bemused,  puzzled  over  how  “material  concerns 
in the wealthiest nations today are as pressing as ever, and the 
pursuit  of  material  needs  as  intense.”  He  saw  humanity  on  a 
hedonic treadmill: “Generation after generation thinks it needs 
only another ten or twenty percent more income to be perfectly 
happy. . . . In the end, the triumph of economic growth is not 
a triumph of humanity over material wants; rather, it is the tri-
umph of material wants over humanity.”34 We do not use our 
wealth to overmaster our wants. Rather, our wants use our wealth 
to continue to overmaster us. And this hedonic treadmill is one

powerful  reason  why,  even  when  all  went  very  well,  we  only 
slouched rather than galloped toward utopia.

Nevertheless,  getting  off  the  treadmill  looks  grim.  Only  a 
fool would wittingly or ignorantly slouch or gallop backward to 
near-universal dire global poverty.

LET ME REMIND YOU, again, that what follows is a grand narra-
tive. Of a necessity, I spend chapters on what others have spent 
books,  indeed  multiple  volumes,  describing.  In  pursuit  of  big 
themes, details necessarily suffer. Moreover, I will, as needed—
which will be often—“pull up the roots” and jump far back in 
time to identify and quickly trace an influential origin story, for 
we  cannot  do  other  than  think  in  narrative  terms.  What  hap-
pened  in  1500,  say,  had  consequences  for  what  happened  in 
1900. Details, gray areas, controversies, historical uncertainties—
they suffer, they suffer greatly, but they suffer for a purpose. To 
date, we humans have failed to see the long twentieth century as 
fundamentally  economic  in  its  significance—and  consequently 
we have failed to take from it all the lessons we must. We have 
drawn lessons aplenty from the myriad political, military, social, 
cultural, and diplomatic histories of these decades. But the eco-
nomic lessons are no less pressing, and, in fact, are more pressing.
The source of all, from which all else flows, was the explosion 
of material wealth that surpassed all precedent: the long twentieth 
century saw those of us who belong to the upper middle class, and 
who  live  in  the  industrial  core  of  the  world  economy,  become 
far richer than the theorists of previous centuries’ utopias could 
imagine. From this explosion flowed five important processes and 
sets of forces that will constitute the major themes of this book:

History became economic: Because of the explosion of wealth, 
the  long  twentieth  century  was  the  first  century  ever  in  which

history was predominantly a matter of economics: the economy 
was  the  dominant  arena  of  events  and  change,  and  economic 
changes were the driving force behind other changes, in a way 
never seen before.

The world globalized: As had never been the case before, things 
happening on other continents became not just minor fringe fac-
tors  but  among  the  central  determinants  of  what  happened  in 
every single place human beings lived.

The  technological  cornucopia  was  the  driver:  Enabling  the 
enormous increase in material wealth—its essential prerequisite, 
in fact—was the explosion in human technological knowledge. 
This required not just a culture and educational system that cre-
ated large numbers of scientists and engineers, and means of com-
munication and memory, so that they could build on previous 
discoveries, but also a market economy structured in such a way 
that it was worth people’s while to funnel resources to scientists 
and engineers so that they could do their jobs.

Governments mismanaged, creating insecurity and dissat-
isfaction: The governments of the long twentieth century had 
little clue as to how to regulate the un-self-regulating market to 
maintain prosperity, to ensure opportunity, or to produce sub-
stantial equality.

Tyrannies intensified:  The  long  twentieth  century’s  tyrannies 
were more brutal and more barbaric than those of any previous 
century—and were, in strange, complicated, and confused ways, 
closely  related  to  the  forces  that  made  the  explosion  of  wealth  
so great.

I write this book to engrave these lessons on our collective 
memories. The only way I know how is to tell you the story, and 
the sub-stories.

My Grand Narrative

The place to start is in the year 1870, with humanity still en-
sorcelled, so that better technology meant not higher living stan-
dards for the typical human, but rather, more people and more 
resource scarcity that ate up nearly all, if not all, of the potential 
for material human betterment. Humanity was then still under 
the spell of a Devil: the Devil of Thomas Robert Malthus.35

He was annoyed by the disquisitions in favor of democracy, 

reason,  feminism,  enlightenment,  and  revolution  that 
crossed his desk. So, just before 1800, English scholar and cleric 
Thomas  Robert  Malthus  wrote  a  counterblast,  his Essay on the 
Principle of Population. His objective? To demonstrate that his ex-
plicit target, William Godwin (the father of Frankenstein author 
Mary  Wollstonecraft  Shelley)—and  all  of  Godwin’s  ilk—were, 
however good their intentions, shortsighted and deluded enemies 
of the public welfare. Rather than revolution to bring about de-
mocracy, reason, feminism, and enlightenment, what humanity 
needed was religious orthodoxy, political monarchy, and familial 
patriarchy.1

Why?  Because  human  sexuality  was  a  nearly  irresistible 
force.  Unless  it  was  somehow  checked—unless  women  were 
kept religious, the world stayed patriarchal, and governmental 
sanctions were in place to keep people from making love except 
under certain approved and stringent conditions—the popula-
tion would always expand until it reached the limit imposed by 
the “positive check”: that is, population would only stop grow-
ing when women became so skinny that ovulation became hit-
or-miss, and when children became so malnourished that their 
immune systems were compromised and ineffective. The good

alternative  Malthus  saw  was  the  “preventative  check”:  a  soci-
ety  in  which  paternal  authority  kept  women  virgins  until  the 
age  of  twenty- ight  or  so,  and  in  which,  even  after  the  age  of 
twenty-eight, government restrictions kept women without the 
blessing of a current marriage from making love, and in which 
religion-induced fear of damnation kept women from evading 
those  restrictions.  Then,  and  only  then,  could  a  population 
settle at a stable equilibrium in which people were (relatively) 
well-nourished and prosperous.

What Malthus wrote was, from his point of view, not false, at 
least for his day and for earlier days as well. The world in the year 
6000 BCE was a world with perhaps 7 million people on it and a 
technological index of 0.051. The standard of living was about 
what the United Nations and academic development economists 
might peg at an average of $2.50 per day, or about $900 a year. 
Fast-forward to the year 1, and we see a world with a great deal of 
accumulated invention, innovation, and technological develop-
ment compared to 6000 BCE. Technology had advanced far, with 
my index having now reached 0.25, but the approximate standard 
of living was still about $900 per year. Why no change? Because 
human sexuality was indeed a nearly irresistible force, as Malthus 
knew, and the world human population had grown from about 
7 million in 6000 BCE to perhaps 170 million in the year 1. The 
economist Greg Clark has estimated English construction-worker 
real wages over time, and this data tells us that, on an index that 
sets these wages in 1800 at 100, construction-worker real wages 
had also been at a value of 100 in 1650, in 1340, in 1260, and 
in  1230.  The  highest  they  had  reached  was  a  value  of  150  in 
1450, after the Black Plague of 1346–1348 had carried off per-
haps one-third of the population of Europe, and after subsequent 
waves of plague, generation by generation, plus peasant revolts, 
had severely limited the power of aristocrats to maintain serfdom. 
From 1450 to 1600, real wages fell back to what would be their 
1800 level.2

Malthus’s proposed cures—orthodoxy, monarchy, and patri-
archy—did not help much to raise this inevitably grim Agrarian 
Age typical human standard of living. By 1870 there had been 
some  improvement,  at  least  in  England.  (But  remember  that  
England in 1870 was by a substantial margin the richest industrial 
nation and by far the most industrial economy in the world.) In 
1870 Clark’s English construction-worker real-wage series stood 
at 170. But there were some who were not impressed: Remember 
John Stuart Mill? There was smart money that then still bet that 
there had not yet been any decisive watershed boundary crossing 
in human destiny.

John Stuart Mill and company did have a point. Had the  
Industrial  Revolution  of  1770–1870  lightened  the  toil  of  the 
overwhelming majority of humanity—even in Britain, the coun-
try at the leading edge? Doubtful. Had it materially raised the 
living standards of the overwhelming majority—even in Brit-
ain? By a little. Compared to how mankind had lived before the 
revolution, it was unquestionably a big deal: steam power and 
iron making and power looms and telegraph wires had provided 
comforts  for  many  and  fortunes  for  a  few.  But  how  humans 
lived had not been transformed. And there were legitimate fears. 
As late as 1919 British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote 
that  while  Malthus’s  Devil  had  been  “chained  up  and  out  of 
sight,” with the catastrophe of World War I, “perhaps we have 
loosed him again.”3

A  fixation  on  food  makes  compelling  sense  to  the  hun-
gry. From the year 1000  BCE to 1500  CE, human populations, 
checked by a shortage of available calories, had grown at a snail’s 
pace, at a rate of 0.09 percent per year, increasing from perhaps 
50 million to perhaps 500 million. There were lots of children, 
but they were too malnourished for enough of them to survive 
long  enough  to  boost  the  overall  population.  Over  these  mil-
lennia the typical standards of living of peasants and craftwork-
ers changed little: they consistently spent half or more of their 

29

available energy and cash securing the bare minimum of essential 
calories and nutrients.

It  could  hardly  have  been  otherwise.  Malthus’s  Devil  made 
certain of that. Population growth ate the benefits of invention 
and innovation in technology and organization, leaving only the 
exploitative upper class noticeably better off. And the average pace 
of invention and innovation in technology and organization was 
anemic: perhaps 0.04 percent per year. (Recall, for context, that 
the average pace starting in around 1870 was 2.1 percent per year.)
That was life up to 1500, when there came a crossing of a 
watershed  boundary:  the  Industrial-Commercial  Revolution. 
The  rate  of  growth  of  humanity’s  technological  and  organiza-
tional  capabilities  took  a  fourfold  upward  leap:  from  the  0.04 
percent per year rate following year 1 to 0.15 percent per year. 
The  ocean going  caravels,  new  horse  breeds,  cattle  and  sheep 
breeds  (the  Merino  sheep,  especially),  invention  of  printing 
presses, recognition of the importance of restoring nitrogen to 
the soil for staple crop growth, canals, carriages, cannons, and 
clocks that had emerged by 1650 were technological marvels and 
were—with the exception of cannons, and for some people cara-
vels—great blessings for humanity. But this growth was not fast 
enough  to  break  the  Devil  of  Malthus’s  spell  in  trapping  hu-
manity in near-universal poverty. Population expansion, by and 
large, kept pace with greater knowledge and offset it. Globally, 
the rich began to live better.4 But the typical person saw little 
benefit—or perhaps suffered a substantial loss. Better technology 
and organization brought increases in production of all types—
including the production of more effective and brutal forms of 
killing, conquest, and slavery.

In 1770, a generation before Malthus wrote his Essay on the 
Principle  of  Population,  there  came  another  watershed  bound-
ary  crossing:  the  coming  of  the  British  Industrial  Revolution. 
The  rate  of  growth  of  humanity’s  technological  and  organiza-
tional capabilities took another upward leap, roughly threefold,

from 0.15 percent to around 0.45 percent per year, and perhaps 
twice that in the heartland of the original Industrial Revolution: 
a  charmed  circle  with  a  radius  of  about  three  hundred  miles 
around the white cliffs of Dover at the southeastern corner of the 
island of Britain (plus offshoots in northeastern North America). 
At this more rapid pace, from 1770 to 1870 more technological 
marvels became commonplace in the North Atlantic and visible 
throughout  much  of  the  rest  of  the  world.  Global  population 
growth accelerated to about 0.5 percent per year, and for the first 
time global production may have exceeded the equivalent of $3 a 
day per head (in today’s money).

The numbers are important: indeed, they are key. As the eco-
nomic historian Robert Fogel once said—echoing my great-great-
uncle, the economic historian Abbott Payson Usher—the secret 
weapon of the economist is the ability to count.5 Remember, we 
humans are narrative-loving animals. Stories with an exciting plot 
and an appropriate end of comeuppances and rewards fascinate 
us. They are how we think. They are how we remember. But in-
dividual stories are only important if they concern individuals at 
a crossroads whose actions end up shaping humanity’s path, or if 
they concern individuals who are especially representative of the 
great swath of humanity. It is only by counting that we can tell 
which stories are at all representative and which decisions truly 
matter. The individual technologies are important. But more im-
portant is their weight: counting up the overall extent to which 
people were becoming more productive at making old things and 
more capable at making new things.

The  causes  of  the  Industrial  Revolution  were  not  foreor-
dained. The revolution was not inevitable. But tracing its causes 
and  the  lack  of  necessity  in  history  is  outside  the  scope  of  my 
book. Theorists of the multiverse assure me that there are other 
worlds out there like ours, worlds that we cannot hear or see or 
touch in much the same way as a radio tuned to one station can-
not pick up all the others. And knowing what we know about

our world leaves me utterly confident that in most of those other 
worlds there was no British Industrial Revolution. That growth 
would more likely than not have leveled out at the Commercial 
Revolution–era  level  of  0.15  percent  per  year  or  the  medieval 
level  of  0.04  percent  per  year.  These  seem  like  far  more  likely  
scenarios:  worlds  of  semipermanent  Gunpowder  Empires  and 
sail-driven global commerce.6

But that is not our world. And even in our world I do not 
think that the Imperial-Commercial and British Industrial Revo-
lutions were decisive.

Consider that the 0.45 percent per year global rate of growth 
of  deployed  human  technological  and  organizational  capabil-
ities typical of the Industrial Revolution era would have been 
eaten up by global population growth of 0.9 percent per year, 
or a hair under 25 percent per generation. Instead of four aver-
age couples having eight children survive to reproduce among 
them, the four couples together have fewer than ten. But with 
even moderately well-fed people, human sexuality can and does 
do  much  more:  British  settler  populations  in  North  America 
in  the  yellow-fever-free  zone  north  of  the  Mason-Dixon  Line 
quadrupled by natural increase along every one hundred years, 
without any of the advantages of modern public health. Con-
sider well-fed but poor people facing high infant mortality and 
desperate  to  have  some  descendants  survive  to  care  for  them 
in their old age. Four such couples could easily have had not 
ten, but fourteen children. A growth of 0.45 percent per year 
in  human  technological  capabilities  was  not  enough  to  even 
start drawing a sorcerous pentagram to contain the Malthusian 
Devil. And so the world of 1870 was a desperately poor world. 
In 1870, more than four-fifths of humans still by the sweat of 
their brow tilled the earth to grow the bulk of the food their 
families ate. Life expectancy was little higher than it had ever 
been, if any. In 1870, 5 ounces of copper were mined per person 
worldwide; by 2016, we mined 5 pounds per person. In 1870, 

32

Globalizing the World

1 pound of steel was produced per person worldwide; by 2016, 
we produced 350 pounds per person.

And would the growth of technological ideas continue at that 
0.45 percent per year global pace of 1770–1870? All of humanity’s 
previous efflorescences had exhausted themselves, and ended in 
renewed economic stagnation, or worse, a Dark Age of conquest. 
Delhi had been sacked by foreign invaders in 1803— Beijing in 
1644, Constantinople in 1453, Baghdad in 1258, Rome in 410, 
Persepolis in 330 BCE, and Nineveh in 612 BCE.

Why should people expect the growth of 1770–1870 not to 
similarly exhaust itself? Why should people expect imperial Lon-
don to confront a different fate?

Economist  William  Stanley  Jevons  made  his  reputation  in 
1865 when he was still a young whippersnapper of thirty-three 
years  old  with  The  Coal  Question:  arguing  that  Britain  at  least 
would within a generation run out of easily accessible coal, and 
then the factories would just . . . stop.7 There was nobody who 
was a bigger believer in the British Empire than Rudyard Kipling. 
The  British  Empire  was  very  good  to  Rudyard  Kipling—until 
September  27,  1915,  when,  during  World  War  I,  it  devoured 
his  son  John  by  killing  him  in  the  bloody  fields  outside  the 
French city of Lille. Yet his reaction to the sixtieth anniversary 
of  Queen-Empress  Victoria  Hanover’s  accession  to  the  throne, 
in 1897, was a poem about London’s destiny being the same as 
Nineveh’s, closing: “For frantic boast and foolish word—/ Thy 
mercy on Thy People, Lord!”8

Thus without a further acceleration—a bigger than Industrial 
Revolution acceleration—of the underlying drivers of economic 
growth, today’s world might indeed have been a Permanent Ste-
ampunk World. It might in 2010 have had a global population 
of the then current 7 billion. But, even if invention had main-
tained  its  1770–1870  average  global  pace,  the  vast  majority  of 
people would have remained at little more than the 1800–1870 
typical  global  standard  of  living.  With  global  technology  and

organization today at about the level of 1910, the airplane might 
still be an infant technological novelty, and the disposal of horse 
manure  our  principal  urban  transportation-management  prob-
lem. We might have not 9 percent, but rather, more like 50 per-
cent, of the world living on $2 per day, and 90 percent living 
below  $5.  Average  farm  sizes  would  be  one-sixth  of  what  they 
had been in 1800, and only the uppermost of the upper classes 
would have what we today regard as a global-north middle-class 
standard of living.

This, of course, is not what happened. What did happen was 
post-1870  innovation  growth  acceleration:  a  third  watershed 
boundary crossing.

Around 1870 the proportional rate of growth of humanity’s 
technological and organizational capabilities took a further four-
fold upward leap to our current 2.1 percent per year or so. There-
after, technology far outran population growth. And thereafter, 
population growth in the richest economies began to decline: hu-
mans became rich enough and long-lived enough that limiting 
fertility became a desirable option.

The period from 1870 to 1914 was, in the perspective of all 
previous eras, “economic El Dorado,” or “economic Utopia,” as 
John Maynard Keynes put it, looking back from 1919.9

The resulting world of 1914 was an odd mix of modernity 
and antiquity. Britain burned 194 million tons of coal in 1914. 
The total coal-equivalent energy consumption of Britain today 
is only 2.5 times that. US railroads carried passengers some 350 
miles per citizen, on average, in 1914. Today US airlines carry 
passengers 3,000 miles per citizen. Yet in 1914, all of Europe 
save France still saw the powerful political and social dominance 
of  agrarian  landlords,  who  still  mostly  saw  themselves  as  de-
scendants of knights who had fought for their kings with their 
swords.

Compared to the past, it was almost utopia. Globally, the real 
wages of unskilled workers in 1914 were half again above their

levels  of  1870.  Such  a  standard  of  living  hadn’t  been  attained 
since before we’d moved to the farm.

Why has every year since 1870 seen as much technological 
and organizational progress as was realized every four years from 
1770 to 1870? (Or as much progress as was realized every twelve 
years from 1500 to 1770? Or every sixty years before 1500?) And 
how did what was originally a geographically concentrated surge 
in and around parts of Europe become a global (albeit unevenly 
so) phenomenon?

To foreshadow a more thorough discussion in Chapter 2, I 
think the answers lie in the coming of the industrial research lab-
oratory, the large modern corporation, and globalization, which 
made the world one global market economy, all of which then 
proceeded to solve the problems that it set itself. And the big-
gest of those problems turned out to be to find a way to ratchet 
up the pace of economic growth. The lab and the corporation 
are what allowed the likes of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla 
to become inventors. They did not have to fulfill the ten other 
roles that their predecessors had had to fill, from impresario to 
human resource manager. That work was left to the corporation. 
This made a huge difference. Invented technologies could be ra-
tionally, routinely, and professionally developed; and then they 
could be rationally, routinely, and professionally deployed.

Was their development around 1870 necessary and inevita-
ble? We can see how many things in history are neither inevi-
table nor necessary—how we are as much the product of what 
didn’t happen as we are of what did. Our history is littered with 
such might-have-beens. Here’s just one: Lillian Cross does not 
hit  assassin  Giuseppe  Zangara  with  her  purse  on  February  15, 
1933, and so his bullet finds the brain of president-elect Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt rather than the lung of Chicago mayor Anton  
Čermák; Roosevelt dies and Čermák lives—and America’s history 
in the Great Depression years of the 1930s is very different. But 
the creation of the industrial research lab was not the action of

one, or of even only a few, humans. It took many working to-
gether, often at cross-purposes, over a course of years. Inevitable? 
No, but many people working together over time does make a 
particular outcome increasingly likely.

We feel that that process could have worked out differently, 
but we have no good way to conceptualize how that might have 
happened, or what the plausible range of different outcomes is. 
As the historian Anton Howes has pointed out, nearly any weaver 
for 5,000 years before 1773 could have made his or her life much 
easier by inventing the flying shuttle. None did until John Kay, 
who  had  no  deep  knowledge  and  used  no  advanced  materials, 
just, as Howes marveled, “two wooden boxes on either side to 
catch the shuttle . . . [and] a string, with a little handle called a 
picker.” Thus, he added, “Kay’s innovation was extraordinary in 
its simplicity.” By comparison, the research lab and the corpora-
tion were complex, and could have perhaps escaped humanity’s 
conceptual grasp.10

The labs and corporations needed accelerants if they were to 
spread and transform the world. The biggest accelerant is clear: 
globalization.

Back before 1700, what we would call “international trade” 
was a trade of high-valued preciosities for precious-metal cash—   
spices, silks, psychoactives (opium, for example), fine manufac-
tures (steel swords, porcelains, and so forth), important and scarce 
raw materials such as tin (essential for making bronze), occasional 
staples transported by ship between and within empires (wheat 
from Egypt and Tunisia to Rome, rice from the Yangtze Delta to 
Beijing)—and slaves: pull humans out of their social context and 
enforce a zero-status hierarchical role on them, and you can get a 
lot of work out of them for a little food. It mattered. It mattered 
a lot as far as the comfort and sophistication of elites was con-
cerned. But it was not an essential force shaping economic life 
(except, of course, from those whom the pre–Industrial Revolu-
tion trade networks enslaved). What we would call “international

trade”  was  at  most  6  percent  of  global  economic  life:  about  
3 percent of what a typical region consumed was imported from 
elsewhere, and about 3 percent of what a typical region produced 
was  exported  elsewhere.  This  began  to  change  after  1700.  Be-
tween 1700 and 1800 the guns-slaves-sugar triangle trade in the 
North Atlantic did become an essential force, powerfully shap-
ing Africa and the Caribbean for great evil, and playing a still- 
debated  role  in  concentrating  and  transferring  to  Britain  the 
wealth of a global seaborne empire, and in setting Britain on its 
path to a market economy, limited government, the Industrial 
Revolution,  and  world  domination.  But  international  trade  in 
1800 was still, at most, just 9 percent of global economic life.

After 1800, cotton and textiles became important additions 
to the list of key commodities in world trade. The cotton was 
imported to the manufacturing heartlands of the British Indus-
trial  Revolution—Britain  itself;  the  regions  immediately  across 
the English Channel, inside a rough circle with a radius of three 
hundred miles, with its center at Dover in the southeastern cor-
ner  of  England;  plus  New  England  in  the  United  States—and 
textiles and other manufactures were exported from those same 
regions to the rest of the world. But world trade in 1865 was still 
only 7 percent of global economic activity.11

There  was  the  globalization  of  transport,  too,  in  the  form 
of  the  iron-hulled  screw-propellered  oceangoing  steamship, 
linked  to  the  railroad  network.  There  was  the  globalization  of 
communication, in the form of the global submarine telegraph 
network, linked to landlines. By 1870 you could communicate 
at near-lightspeed from London to Bombay and back, by 1876 
from London to New Zealand and back.

Yet another aspect of globalization was a lack of barriers. Of 
the consequences arising from open borders, the most influential 
was  migration—with  the  very  important  caveat  that  the  poor-
est migrants, those from China, India, and so on, were not al-
lowed  into  the  temperate  settlements.  Those  were  reserved  for

Europeans (and sometimes Middle Easterners). Caveat aside, a 
vast population of people moved: between 1870 and 1914, one in 
fourteen humans—one hundred million people—changed their 
continent of residence.12

The embrace of openness by world governments also meant 
the absence of legal barriers to trade, investment, and commu-
nication. As people moved, finance, machines, railroads, steam-
ships,  and  the  telegraph  nerves  of  production  and  distribution 
networks followed, chasing abundant natural, physical, and bio-
logical resources. The proportion of global economic activity that 
was traded across today’s national borders rose from perhaps 9 
percent in 1870 to perhaps 15 percent in 1914, as the revolution-
ary decreases in the cost of transport massively outstripped what 
were  also  that  era’s  revolutionary  decreases  and  differentials  in 
costs of production. Thus transportation made a huge difference.

Consider the railroad.
The metallurgy to cheaply make rails and engines made trans-
port over land, at least wherever the rails ran, as cheap as travel up 
navigable watercourses or across the oceans, and made it faster.

Some  groused.  The  mid-nineteenth-century  Massachusetts 
transcendentalist author and activist Henry David Thoreau’s re-
sponse to the railroad was: “Get off my lawn!”

Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activ-
ity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length 
ride  somewhere  in  next  to  no  time  and  for  nothing,  but 
though a crowd rushes to the depot and the conductor shouts 
“All aboard!” when the smoke is blown away and the vapor 
condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the 
rest are run over—and it will be called, and will be, “a melan-
choly accident.”13

My  ancestors,  and  most  of  humanity,  had  a  very  different 

view.

Globalizing the World

Before  the  railroad,  as  a  general  rule  you  simply  could  not 
transport  agricultural  goods  more  than  one  hundred  miles  by 
land. By that mile-marker, the horses or oxen would have eaten 
as much as they could pull. Either you found a navigable water-
course—ideally  much,  much  closer  than  one  hundred  miles 
away—or you were stuck in bare self-sufficiency for all your sta-
ples. This also meant that, overwhelmingly, what you wore, ate, 
and used to pass your hours was made within your local town-
ship, or dearly bought.

For Thoreau, the fact that it took him a day to walk or ride 
into Boston was a benefit—part of living deliberately. But his was 
the point of view of a rich guy, or at least of a guy without a family 
to care for, and for whom Ralph Waldo Emerson’s second wife, 
Lidian Jackson, was willing to bake pies.

The laboratory, the corporation, global transportation, global 
communications,  and  falling  barriers—together,  these  factors 
were  more  than  enough  to  trigger  the  decisive  watershed  and 
carry humanity out of Malthusian poverty. They also made the 
story of the world’s economies one story in a way that had never 
been true before.

Given  our  global  propensity  to  live  close  to  navigable  wa-
ter,  perhaps  the  biggest  revolution  in  transportation  came  not 
in the 1830s, with the railroad, but later, with the iron-hulled 
ocean going coal-fired steamship. In 1870 the Harland and Wolff 
shipyard  of  Belfast  launched  the  iron-hulled,  steam-powered, 
screw-propellered  passenger  steamship  RMS  Oceanic.  It  prom-
ised to take nine days to go from Liverpool to New York, a jour-
ney that in 1800 would have taken more like a month.

The Oceanic’s crew of 150 supported 1,000 third-class pas-
sengers at a cost of £3 each—the rough equivalent of a month 
and a half’s wages for an unskilled worker—and 150 first-class 
passengers  at  £15  each.14  In  today’s  dollars,  the  same  share  of 
average income for the first-class seats comes to $17,000. But the 
more relevant context is to the 1870s’ recent past. A generation

earlier, a third-class berth on the (slower and less safe) equivalent 
of the Oceanic cost twice as much, and that berth cost four times 
as much in 1800. After 1870, sending a family member across 
the ocean to work became a possibility open to all save the very 
poorest of European households.

And humans responded by the millions. The production and 
trade globalization of the late 1800s was fueled by 100 million 
people  leaving  their  continent  of  origin  to  live  and  work  else-
where. Never before or since have we seen such a rapid propor-
tional redistribution of humanity around the globe.

Some  50  million  people  left  the  settled  areas  of  Europe, 
mainly for the Americas and Australasia, but also for South Af-
rica, the highlands of Kenya, the black-earth western regions of 
the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and elsewhere. It was an extraordinary 
age, 1870–1914, in which working-class people could repeatedly 
cross oceans in search of better lives.

If I have my family history right, all of my ancestors had made 
it  to  the  United  States  by  1800,  back  in  the  days  when  cross-
ocean  migration  was  for  people  who  had  been  enslaved,  were 
indentured, or were middle class. The last that I know of was Ed-
mund Edward Gallagher (born in Watmeath, Ireland, in 1772). 
He and Lydia McGinnis (born in New Hampshire in 1780) were 
living at the start of the 1800s in Chester, Pennsylvania, where 
they recorded the birth of their son John. But all of my wife’s an-
cestors came here during the post-1870 great wave of global mi-
gration. One was Maria Rosa Silva, born in 1873 in Portugal. She 
arrives in 1892. In 1893, in Lowell, Massachusetts, she marries 
José F. Gill, born in 1872, not in Portugal but on the Portuguese- 
speaking island of Madeira. He had arrived in 1891—not on a 
ship to Boston, but to Savannah.

Perhaps he knew sugarcane, and heard that Savannah had it, 
but decided that he was too Black in Savannah, and so decamped 
to Lowell. We do not know. We do know that they and their 
children, Mary, John Francis, and Carrie, went back across the

Atlantic from Boston to Madeira soon after 1900. And we know 
that he died in South Africa in 1903. We find Maria Rosa and 
four children—a newborn Joseph added—going back across that 
Atlantic and, in the 1910 census, in Fall River, Massachusetts, 
where she is recorded as a widowed weaver renting a house, with 
five children born and four living.

The migrations were not always one way. As we have seen 
with  José  Gill  and  Maria  Rosa  Silva,  some  people  crossed  the  
Atlantic multiple times. One person who made the reverse jour-
ney  permanently—born  in  America,  moved  to  England—was 
Jennie Jerome, born in 1854, the daughter of New York finan-
cier Leonard Jerome and Clara Hall. The occasion was her mar-
riage to Lord Randolph Spencer-Churchill, younger son of the 
7th Duke of Marlborough. The couple became engaged in 1873, 
just three days after their first meeting at a sailing regatta off the 
Isle of Wight in the English Channel. Their marriage was then 
delayed  for  seven  months,  while  Jennie’s  father,  Leonard,  and 
the groom’s father, the Duke, John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 
argued over how much money she would bring to the marriage 
and how it would be safeguarded. Their son Winston was born 
eight months after their marriage. They had another son, John, 
six years later.15

Randolph died about two decades later, in 1895, at the age of 
forty-five, perhaps of syphilis, certainly of something with a pro-
nounced neurological character. The diagnosis on the death cer-
tificate is “general paralysis of the insane.” Jennie was thereafter 
“much admired by the Prince of Wales” and others, as they put it 
in those days. In 1900 she married George Cornwallis-West, who 
was a month older than Winston.

Winston  Spencer  Churchill—he  dropped  the  hyphen  and 
turned the first half of his last name into a middle name—would 
be  the  enfant  terrible  of  British  politics  when  young,  a  disas-
trous British chancellor of the exchequer—the equivalent of fi-
nance minister or treasury secretary—when middle-aged, and a

decisive factor in defeating the Nazis as British prime minister 
during World War II. And not least of Winston’s excellences as 
a wartime prime minister was that he was half American, and so 
knew how to talk to America, and particularly how to talk to then 
American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Though the redwood forests of northern California contain 
shrines to the Boddhisatva Guan-Yin, migration from China to 
European-settled  California  and  to  the  rest  of  the  temperate- 
climate settler colonies and ex-colonies was quickly shut down. 
Plutocrats such as Leland Stanford (the railroad baron and gover-
nor of California who founded and endowed Stanford University 
in memory of his son) might have favored immigration, but the 
populists favored exclusion. For the most part, they were unable 
to staunch the flow of Europeans and Eastern Europeans, but they 
were largely able to enforce “Chinaman go home.” People from 
the Indian subcontinent fell into the same category in this respect.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in 1869, the son 
of Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, the prime minister of the 
small British-allied and -subject principality of Porbandar on the 
peninsula of Kathiawar, and of Karamchand’s fourth wife, Putli-
bai.16 When he was fourteen their families married him and Kas-
turbai. In 1888, at the age of eighteen, he sailed from Mumbai to 
England to study law. Three years later, at the age of twenty-two, 
he was a lawyer, and sailed back to India. He did not do well in 
his career. In 1893 he ran across a merchant who needed a lawyer 
to try to collect a £40,000 debt in South Africa. Gandhi volun-
teered for the job and again crossed the ocean. He thought he was 
going for a year. But he decided to stay. In 1897 he went back 
to India to collect his family and bring them to South Africa. He 
would remain in South Africa for twenty-two years. And it was 
there that he became an anti-imperialist, a politician, and an ac-
tivist, for in South Africa people from the Indian south continent 
were not treated as badly as indigenous African peoples, but they 
were at most only one step higher.

Another participant in these great migrations was Deng Xiao-
ping, born in 1904 as the son of a middling-rich landlord whose 
income was perhaps five times the Chinese average at the time.17 
In December 1920 he arrived in France to work and study: World 
War I, from 1914 to 1918, had pulled huge numbers of workers 
into the army and left them dead and maimed. The French gov-
ernment was eager to allow anyone who wanted to replace them 
in, both during and after the war. Deng took advantage of the 
postwar part of the program. He worked as a fitter—a metal-parts 
fabricator—in the suburbs of Paris at a Le Creusot factory. There 
he became a communist and met many other future leaders of 
the Chinese Communist Party, including Zhou Enlai. In 1926 
he studied in Moscow at its Sun Yat-sen University, and in 1927 
he  returned  to  China  to  become  first  a  cadre  and  then  a  high 
official in the Chinese Communist Party. During the Mao era, 
he was twice purged, the first time as the “number-two person in 
authority taking the capitalist road,” and yet he became China’s 
paramount leader as the country finally stood up in the 1980s, 
and may well have been the most consequential single figure in 
the history of the long twentieth century.

Throughout the temperate-zone lands settled from Europe, 
local  populists  were  overwhelmingly  successful  in  keeping  the 
United States, Canada, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Australia, and 
New Zealand “European.” The flow of migrants out of China 
and India was directed elsewhere, to the tea plantations of Ceylon 
or the rubber plantations of Malaya. Still, fifty million Chinese 
and  Indians  migrated,  going  instead  to  South  Asia,  Africa,  the 
Caribbean, and the highlands of Peru.

Resource-rich settlement areas such as Canada and Argentina 
with Europe-like climates provided a further boost to European 
living standards. The one-third who migrated and then returned 
home did so, in most cases, with resources that made them solid 
members  of  their  home  economies’  middle  classes.  The  two-
thirds who migrated and stayed found their living standards and

their children’s living standards higher by a factor of between 1.5 
and 3. Those left behind also benefited. Ultimately, these decades 
of migration raised wages in Europe, as workers at home faced 
less competition for jobs and could buy cheap imports from the 
New World.18

Plutocrat  and  populist  alike  benefited.  Indeed,  there  is  no 
sign that workers already on the labor-scarce western, peripheral 
side of the Atlantic lost out as their shores absorbed the migra-
tion  wave  from  labor-abundant  Europe.  Real  wages  in  Amer-
ica,  Canada,  and  Argentina  appear  to  have  grown  at  1.0,  1.7, 
and  1.7  percent  per  year,  respectively,  in  the  years  leading  up 
to 1914—compared to growth rates that averaged 0.9 percent 
per year in northwestern Europe. Only in Australia, where real 
wages seemed to stagnate in the half-century before 1914, does 
increased trade appear to have played any role in eroding the rel-
ative wages of workers in a labor-scarce economy. Regardless, mi-
gration to temperate- zone countries meant people carried capital 
with them, which built out the scale of the recipient economies.19
Did migration lower relative wages in tropical-zone recipient 
economies? Yes—and such was the case in economies that never 
saw a migrant. British capital, Brazilian-stock rubber plants, and 
labor imported from China to Malaya could and did put heavy 
downward pressure on the wages of workers in Brazil who did 
not know there was such a place as Malaya. Economic underde-
velopment  was  a  process,  something  that  itself  developed  over 
1870–1914.

And migration did not raise wages much in the migration- 
source economies of China and India. Both had such substantial 
populations that emigration was a drop in the bucket.

Through misfortune and bad government, India and China 
had failed to escape the shackles of the Malthusian Devil. Tech-
nology had advanced, but improvements in productive potential 
had been absorbed by rising populations, and not in rising living

standards. The population of China in the late nineteenth cen-
tury was three times what it had been at the start of the second 
millennium in the year 1000. So potential migrants from China 
and India were willing to move for what to Europeans seemed to 
be starvation wages.

Thus, the large populations and low levels of material wealth 
and  agricultural  productivity  in  China  and  India  checked  the 
growth  of  wages  in  any  of  the  areas—Malaya,  Indonesia,  the  
Caribbean,  or  East  Africa—open  to  Asian  migration.  Workers 
could be cheaply imported and employed at wages not that far 
above the level of physical subsistence. Nevertheless, these work-
ers sought out these jobs: their opportunities and living standards 
in Malaya or on African plantations were significantly above what 
they could expect if they returned to India or China. Low wage 
costs  meant  that  commodities  produced  in  countries  open  to 
Asian immigration were relatively cheap. And competition from 
the Malayan rubber plantations checked growth and even pushed 
down wages in the Brazilian rubber plantations. The result: liv-
ing standards and wage rates during the late nineteenth century 
remained low, albeit higher than in China and India, throughout 
the regions that would come to be called the global south.

For ill and good, the world was now an integrated unit, with 

one story.

Part of this global story was the emergence of a sharp division 
of international labor: “Tropical” regions supplied rubber, coffee, 
sugar, vegetable oil, cotton, and other relatively low-value agri-
cultural products to Europe. Temperate-zone regions of expand-
ing European settlement—the United States, Canada, Australia, 
New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Ukraine, and perhaps 
South  Africa—produced  and  shipped  staple  grains,  meats,  and 
wool  to  Europe.  German  farmers  found  themselves  with  new 
competitors, and not just from the Americas: as much came in 
the form of Russian grain shipped from Odessa. Western Europe

paid for its imports by exporting manufactured goods. As did the 
northeastern United States, where industrial supplies and materi-
als would rise to be fully half of US exports by 1910.

And as wages in economies that were to become the global 
periphery diminished, so, too, did the possibility that this per-
iphery would develop a rich enough middle class to provide de-
mand for a strong domestic industrial sector.

To understand why, consider the British Empire.
Wherever the British went they built a fort, some docks, and 
a botanical garden—the latter to discover what valuable plants 
grown elsewhere might flourish under the guns of their fort as 
well. During the nineteenth century it was the British Empire that 
brought the rubber plant from Brazil to Kew Gardens, and then 
to Malaya, and that brought the tea shrub directly from China to 
Ceylon. Although rubber was not introduced into Malaya, Indo-
nesia, and Indochina until the last quarter of the nineteenth cen-
tury, by the end of World War I these three regions had become 
the principal sources of the world’s natural rubber supply. Most 
of this process was mediated by the British Empire, but not all. 
The Portuguese brought the coffee bush from Yemen to Brazil. 
The comparative advantages of the regions that were to become 
the  periphery  of  the  late  nineteenth-century  global  economy  
were not so much given as made.20

The  United  States  was  the  most  prominent  long-run  ben-
eficiary.  Casting  our  glance,  briefly,  out  into  the  future,  these 
decades of migration in the 1800s and early 1900s were crucial 
steps  on  the  path  that  turned  the  long  twentieth  century  into 
an era of US predominance. Consider that in 1860 the United 
States had a population of full citizens, with women and chil-
dren included— that is, “Caucasian” English speakers whom the 
government regarded as worth educating—of 25 million, while 
Britain  and  its  Dominions  had  a  full-citizen  population  of  32 
million. By the midpoint between 1870 and 2010, 1940, things 
had massively changed: the United States had 116 million full

citizens, and Britain and its Dominions had 75 million. Natural 
increase had multiplied both populations, and so it was immi-
grants, welcomed and assimilated, who gave the United States 
greater heft than the British Empire by 1940.

The decades between 1870 and 1914 were a time of tech-
nological advance, population growth, and migration, and with 
transportation and communication advances came a concomi-
tant rise in trade and investment. The cost of transporting peo-
ple fell alongside the cost of transporting goods: flour that cost 
1.5 cents per pound in Chicago and 3 cents per pound in Lon-
don in 1850 cost only 2 cents per pound in London in 1890. In-
deed, every commodity that was neither exceptionally fragile nor 
spoilable could, after 1870, be carried from port to port across 
oceans for less than it cost to move it within any country.21 As 
long as there were docks and railroads, every place in the world 
became cheek-by-jowl to every other place. Everyone’s opportu-
nities and constraints depended on what was going on in every 
other piece of the world economy.

This mattered: between 1870 and 1914, exports as a share 
of  national  product  doubled  in  India  and  in  Indonesia  and 
more than tripled in China. And in Japan—which was forced 
out  of  two  and  a  half  centuries  of  Tokugawa  isolationism  by 
US gunboats— exports rose from practically zero to 7 percent of 
the national product in just two pre–World War I generations. 
In 1500, international trade as a proportion of total world pro-
duction had been around 1.5 percent. By 1700, it had risen to 
around 3 percent. By 1850, to about 4 percent. In 1880, it was 
11 percent, and by 1913, 17 percent. Today it is 30 percent.22

The story of this rise from 1870 to 1914 is what international 
economist  Richard  Baldwin  has  called  the  “first  unbundling”: 
the mammoth fall in shipping costs that substantially meant that 
the use and consumption of goods no longer substantially had 
to  be  “bundled”  in  the  same  region  as  their  production.  You 
could produce where it was cheapest, transport it inexpensively,

and have use and consumption take place where the wealth to 
purchase it was located.23

But this did not “make the world flat” in any sense. If you were 
doing  anything  more  complicated  than  buying  a  simple,  well- 
understood,  known-quality  good,  you  had  to  communicate—
they had to learn what you wanted, you had to learn what their 
production capabilities were, and you had to reach a meeting-of-
the-minds about how both of you should best adjust. You also had 
to look them in the eye, face to face, to understand with what and 
how far they could be trusted. Baldwin’s “first unbundling” meant 
that production could and did move away from use and consump-
tion, but it did not just move to that point on the transport net-
work where resources were most available. It moved together, into 
industrial districts, so that producers could economize on the costs 
associated with communications and meetings-of-the-minds, and 
with face-to-face negotiations and trust.

The factories came to be located near each other. This meant 
that the industrial research labs and the new ideas were concen-
trated as well—and the still-high costs of communications meant 
that the ideas tended to stick in one place. The goods could be 
carried and used anywhere on the transport network. But they 
could  only  be  most  cheaply  and  efficiently  produced  in  a  few 
places worldwide. Thus the world boomed in its pre-1914 eco-
nomic El Dorado. And the global north industrialized. The ser-
pent in the garden was that the world diverged in relative income 
levels: as the market giveth (in this case, to the global north), so 
it may taketh away (as it did in what was to become the global 
south, which industrialized far less, in many places industrialized 
not at all, and in important places deindustrialized).24

Northwestern Europe gained an enormous comparative ad-
vantage in making manufactured goods. And natural resources 
out on the periphery became more valuable as well: copper, coal, 
coffee, and all mineral and agricultural products could be shipped

oceangoing cargo ships lay. The market economy responded as 
knowledge  sped  along  copper  wires.  The  industrializing  core 
specialized  in  the  manufactures  because  of  its  superior  access 
to industrial technologies. The periphery specialized in the pri-
mary products that its newly improving infrastructure allowed 
it to export. The ability for both to specialize was of great eco-
nomic value.

The social returns on the investments in technology and infra-
structure that created this late nineteenth-century world economy 
were  enormous.  Consider  just  one  example:  economic  histo-
rian Robert Fogel calculated that the social rate of return on the 
Union Pacific’s Transcontinental Railroad was some 30 percent 
per year.25

The growth of trade meant that the logic of comparative ad-
vantage could be deployed to its limit. Wherever there was a dif-
ference  across  two  countries  in  the  value  of  textiles  relative  to 
ironmongery—or any other two non-spoilable goods—there was 
profit to be made and societal well-being to be enhanced by ex-
porting the good that was relatively cheap in your country and 
importing the good that was relatively dear. Once established, a 
comparative advantage tended to stick for a long time. There was 
nothing about British-invented automated textile machinery that 
made it work better in Britain than elsewhere. Yet Britain’s cot-
ton textile exports rose decade after decade from 1800 to 1910, 
peaking at 1.1 billion pounds a year in the years before World 
War I.26

The reach of comparative advantage was also broad. A country 
near-hapless in growing food but even less capable of making ma-
chine tools could improve its lot by exporting food and importing 
machine tools. A country that was best-in-class at making auto-
mobiles, but even better, in relative terms, at making airplanes, 
could get ahead by exporting airplanes and importing cars. Such 
was  the  power  of  expanding  world  trade.  Whether  one’s  com-
parative advantage came from innovative entrepreneurs, a deeper

community of engineering practice, a well-educated workforce, 
abundant natural resources, or just poverty that made your labor 
cheap, business could profit and society grow richer. And so the 
surge in real wages was worldwide, not confined to where indus-
trial technologies were then being deployed.

This  was  the  consequence  of  finance  and  trade  following 
labor.  The  1870–1914  world  economy  was  a  high-investment 
economy—in  historical  comparative  perspective.  The  indus-
trialization of Western Europe and of the East and Midwest of 
North America provided enough workers to make the industrial 
products to satisfy global demands, and also to build the railways, 
ships, ports, cranes, telegraph lines, and other pieces of transport 
and communications infrastructure to make the first global econ-
omy a reality. There were twenty thousand miles of railways in 
the world when the American Civil War ended in 1865. There 
were three hundred thousand miles in 1914. (There are a million 
miles of rails worldwide today.)

Workers in Hamburg, Germany, ate cheap bread made from 
North Dakotan or Ukrainian wheat. Investors in London financed 
copper mines in Montana and railroads in California. (And rail-
road baron Leland Stanford diverted a large tranche into his own 
pockets.) State-funded entrepreneurs in Tokyo bought electrical 
machinery made by the workers of Hamburg. And the telegraph 
wires that connected all were made of copper from Montana and 
insulated by rubber gathered by Chinese workers in Malaya and 
Indian workers in Bengal.

As John Maynard Keynes would write in 1919, the upshot 
was that, for the globe’s middle and upper classes, by 1914 “life 
offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, 
comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and 
most powerful monarchs of other ages.”27

And  the  upshot  for  the  working  classes  of  the  globe—at 
least those touched by ships and railroads and by international 
commerce—was an increasing margin between living standards

and bare subsistence. Malthusian forces responded: as of 1914 
there were five people where there had been four a generation 
before.  Half  a  century  saw  more  population  growth  than  had 
taken place over half a millennium back in the Agrarian Age. Yet 
there was no sign of downward pressure on nutrition standards. 
Investment and technology meant that, for the first time ever, as 
population grew, available resources, including nutrition, more 
than kept pace. Malthus’s Devil was chained.

Consider the ability to communicate.
Around 1800, Arthur Wellesley, a fourth son of a financially 
shaky Anglo Irish aristocratic family, a man whose only obvious 
talent was as a not-incompetent but definitely amateur-class vi-
olin player, sought to make his fortune and reputation. He had 
bought himself a post as a major in the British Army’s 33rd Reg-
iment of Foot. (The British government believed that an officer 
corps overwhelmingly staffed by the relatives of rich, established 
landlords  would  never  repeat  the  quasi-military  dictatorship  of 
1650–1660, hence the rule was that officers had to buy their posts, 
and so the only men who could become officers were those with 
close landlord relatives willing to lend or give them the money.) 
His  elder  brother  Richard  then  loaned  him  the  money  to  buy 
the  step-up  to  lieutenant  colonel.  Richard  was  then  appointed 
viceroy of India, and so Arthur, the future Duke of Wellington, 
went along for the ride, banking correctly that nepotism would 
lead his brother to make him a general. His brother did. Ever af-
ter, Arthur Wellesley, the only general ever to command an army 
that overwhelmed an army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, 
would say that the battle where he had been at his best as a general 
was the first one he ever commanded: Assaye in Maharashtra, the 
battle that won the Second Anglo-Maratha War.28

It took Arthur Wellesley seven months to get to India from 
Britain. It would take him six months to get back. That time lag 
meant, among other things, that whatever questions, instructions, 
and orders the British imperial cabinet and the directors of the

East India Company asked him to convey to their proconsuls in 
India would be a year stale by the time they even reached Fort Wil-
liam in Calcutta, Fort St. George in Chennai, or Bombay Castle. 
A conversation where a single question-and-answer interchange 
takes a year is not a dialogue: it is two overlapping monologues. 
And conveying attitudes, practices, capabilities, and goals across 
such a gulf is haphazard to the point of being hazardous.

The  electric  telegraph  allowed  a  conversation.  It  connected 
points on the globe as messages sped through copper at nearly the 
speed of light.

Not everyone was welcoming. Henry David Thoreau, again, 
groused: “We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph 
from  Maine  to  Texas,  but  Maine  and  Texas,  it  may  be,  have 
nothing important to communicate.”29

While Texas may not have had much important to learn from 
Maine, in the summer of 1860 Texas had a great deal to learn 
from Chicago: the Republican Party National Convention meet-
ing  at  the  Wigwam  nominated  Abraham  Lincoln  as  its  candi-
date for president. So started a chain of events that would kill 
twenty-five thousand white adult Texans and maim twenty-five 
thousand more, and that would free all two hundred thousand 
enslaved Black Texans within five years. Maine may not have had 
much to learn from Texas, but telegraphs reporting relative prices 
of Grand Bank codfish in Boston, Providence, New York, and 
Philadelphia were of great importance to Maine fishermen slip-
ping their moorings.

Knowing the price of codfish is valuable, the freeing of hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans is profound, and both only hint 
at  the  shift  that  came  with  telegraphed  intelligence.  Ever  since 
the  development  of  language,  one  of  humanity’s  great  powers 
has been that our drive to talk and gossip truly turns us into an 
anthology  intelligence.  What  one  of  us  in  the  group  knows,  if 
it is useful, pretty quickly everyone in the group knows, and of-
ten those well beyond the group, too. The telegraph enlarges the

relevant group from the village or township or guild to, poten-
tially, the entire world.

Spanning the globe with telegraphs was difficult. Particularly 
difficult to set up were the submarine telegraph cables. The year 
1870 saw the English engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s SS 
Great Eastern—then the largest ship ever built (nothing larger was 
to be built until 1901)—lay the submarine telegraph cable from 
Yemen to Mumbai, completing the undersea line from London. 
Future dukes of Wellington, and millions besides, no longer took 
months conveying news and commands from London to Bom-
bay and back. It took only minutes. After 1870 you could find 
out in the morning how your investments overseas had done the 
previous day, and wire instructions and questions to your bankers 
overseas before lunch.

This mattered for three reasons:
First,  this  process  brought  not  just  more  information  with 
which  to  make  decisions;  it  also  improved  trust  and  security. 
Consider that 1871 saw thirty-four-year-old American financier 
J.  Pierpont  Morgan  join  forty-five-year-old  American  financier 
Anthony Drexel in an investment banking partnership to guide 
and profit from the flow of investment funds from capital-rich 
Britain to the resource- and land-abundant United States. Today’s 
J. P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are the children of that 
partnership.30 Second, this greatly aided technology transfer—the 
ability in one corner of the globe to use technologies and meth-
ods invented or in use in another corner of the globe. Third, this 
process was a handmaiden of empire. Where you could cheaply 
and reliably communicate and move goods and people, you could 
also command and move and supply armies. Thus conquest, or at 
least invasion and devastation, became things that any European 
great power could undertake in nearly any corner of the world. 
And the European powers did.

Before 1870 European imperialism was—with the very no-
table exception of the British Raj in India—largely a matter of 

53

ports  and  their  hinterlands.  By  1914  only  Morocco,  Ethiopia, 
Iran, Afghanistan, Nepal, Thailand, Tibet, China, and Japan had 
escaped European (or, in the case of Taiwan and Korea, Japanese) 
conquest or domination.

BY  THE  END  OF the 1800s, with the greatly increased speed of 
transmitting information, the greatly lowered cost of transporting 
people, and the greatly lowered cost of transporting machines, it 
seemed as though, for the first time in history, it ought to have 
been possible to apply any productive technology known to hu-
manity in any corner of the world.

There were textile factories in places such as Mumbai, Cal-
cutta, Shanghai, Cape Town, and Tokyo, as well as in Manches-
ter,  in  Fall  River,  Massachusetts,  and  in  Brussels.  The  North 
Atlantic economic core supported these endeavors with capital, 
labor, organization, and demand, which is to say its need for and 
willingness  to  buy  products  from  the  periphery.  Before  1870 
Western Europe’s staple imports were limited to cotton, tobacco, 
sugar, and wool—with small quantities of palm oil, furs, hides, 
tea,  and  coffee  as  well:  luxuries,  not  necessities  or  even  conve-
niences. After 1870, however, technology demanded oil for diesel 
and gasoline engines, nitrate for fertilizing fields, copper wiring, 
and rubber tires. And even without new technologies, the much 
richer  post-1870  North  Atlantic  core’s  demand  for  cocoa,  tea, 
coffee, silk, jute, palm oil, and other tropical products skyrock-
eted.  Commodity  demand  and  industrial  technology  transfer 
ought to have begun to draw the world together. But they didn’t.
As Saint Lucia–born trade and development economist Arthur 
Lewis put it, the net effect of the coming of a single economic 
world was to enable a great many countries and regions to jump 
on an “escalator” of modern economic growth that would raise 
them “to ever higher levels of output per head.” Yet Lewis judged 
that as of 1870, only six countries were fully on the escalator.31

We glimpse why there were so few of them in the story of the 
khedive, or viceroy, of Egypt from 1805 to 1848, Muhammed 
Ali. His foremost desire was to transform his country so his grand-
children would not be the puppets of French bankers and British 
proconsuls. One way in which he set out to achieve this dream 
was  by  seeking  to  turn  Egypt  into  a  center  of  textile  manufac-
ture. The problem was that keeping the machines working proved 
unachievable. His textile factories stopped. And his grandson, Is-
mail, who became khedive in 1863, indeed became the puppet of 
French bankers and British proconsuls.32

It is understandable that China, India, and the other regions 
of what would become the post–World War II global south did 
not  produce  and  export  the  relatively  high-value  commodities, 
such as wheat and wool, that were exported by temperate settler 
economies: agricultural productivity was too low, and the climate 
was  unfavorable.  It  is  understandable  why—with  heavy  down-
ward pressure put on wages in Malaya, Kenya, and Colombia by 
migration and threatened migration from China and India—the 
prices of the export commodities that they did produce started 
out and remained relatively low.

What is more puzzling is why industrialization did not spread 
much  more  rapidly  to  the  future  global  south  in  the  years  be-
fore World War I. After all, the example of the North Atlantic 
industrial  core  seemed  easy  to  follow.  Inventing  the  technolo-
gies of the original British Industrial Revolution—steam power, 
spinning  mills,  automatic  looms,  iron-  and  steel-making,  and 
railroad-building—had  required  many  independent  strokes  of 
genius. But copying those technologies did not, especially when 
you could buy and cheaply ship the same industrial equipment 
that supplied the industries of England and the United States.

If  Henry  Ford  could  redesign  production  so  that  unskilled 
assembly-line  workers  could  do  what  skilled  craftsmen  used  to 
do, why couldn’t Ford—or someone else—also redesign produc-
tion so that unskilled and even lower-wage Peruvians or Poles or

Kenyans  could  do  what  Americans  were  then  doing?  After  all, 
even by 1914, Americans were extraordinarily expensive labor by 
world standards.

Did the difficulty lie in political risks? Was the decisive fac-
tor the relative advantage afforded by being near your machine 
suppliers and other factories making similar products? Was it the 
need to have specialists close at hand to fix the many things that 
can go wrong?

It remains a great puzzle to me. And not just to me, but to 
other economic historians as well. We understand far too little 
about why the pace of technological diffusion outside of the in-
dustrial core was so slow before World War I.

“Peripheral”  economies  did  a  superb  job  at  specializing  in 
plantation  agriculture  for  export.  They  did  a  bad  job  at  creat-
ing modern manufacturing industries that could have also turned 
their  low  relative  wages  into  a  durable  source  of  comparative 
advantage.

When I am asked why this happened, I say that the initial cost 
advantage enjoyed by Britain (and then the United States, and 
then Germany) was so huge that it would have required stagger-
ingly high tariffs in order to nurture “infant industries” in other 
locations. I say that colonial rulers refused to let the colonized 
try. I say that the ideological dominance of free trade kept many 
others from even considering the possibility. Few even thought of 
taking a few steps away from the ideology of free trade as the be-
all and end-all toward the practical political economy of Alexan-
der Hamilton and company. Yet a Hamiltonian “developmental 
state” approach might have mightily benefited their economies in 
the long run.33

Unmanaged, a market economy will strive to its utmost to 
satisfy the desires of those who hold the valuable property rights. 
But valuable property owners seek a high standard of living for 
themselves  boosted  by  purchase  of  foreign  luxuries.  They  are 
not patient people who wish to enable and accelerate long-run

growth,  let  alone  encourage  the  trickling-down  of  wealth  and 
opportunity  to  the  working  class.  Moreover,  while  the  market 
economy sees the profits from establishing plantations, and from 
the revenues that can be charged for the use of infrastructure such 
as railroads and docks, it does not see and cannot take account of 
the knowledge that workers and engineers gain from being part 
of a community of practice. Watching what goes wrong and right 
with pioneers and competitors, and listening to them boast when 
things  go  right  and  commiserating  with  them  when  things  go 
wrong with their enterprises, is a powerful social channel for pro-
ductivity growth. Yet there was no money flow associated with 
conversations at Silicon Valley’s Wagon Wheel Bar Grill.34 And 
so the market cannot see the benefits to the economy.

Such “acquired skill and experience,” John Stuart Mill wrote, 
can create a “superiority of one country over another in a branch 
of production . . . aris[ing] only from having begun it sooner . . .  
[with] no inherent advantage.” But—unless managed— the mar-
ket economy’s maximum-profitability test would keep that skill 
and experience from ever being acquired. And so 1870–1950 saw 
the  most  profitable  and  the  most  innovation- supporting  parts 
of economic activity becoming more and more concentrated in 
what we now call the global north.35

The  economic  historian  Robert  Allen  thinks  the  dominant 
factor was imperialism: colonial governments were uninterested in 
adopting a “standard package”—ports, railroads, schools, banks, 
plus  “infant  industry”  tariffs  in  sectors  just  beyond  currently 
profitable export industries—of policy measures that would have 
enabled industrialization. Arthur Lewis thought that the most im-
portant issue was migration and global commodity trade: indus-
trialization  required  a  prosperous  domestic  middle  class  to  buy 
the products of the factories, and tropical economies could not 
develop one. Economic historian Joel Mokyr thinks that it was 
the habits of thought and intellectual exchange developed during 
the  European  Enlightenment  that  laid  the  groundwork  for  the

communities of engineering practice upon which the North Atlan-
tic core’s industrial power was based. And development economist 
Raul Prebisch thought that what mattered most were the landlord 
aristocracies  notionally  descended  from  Castilian  conquistadores, 
who thought their dominance over society could best be main-
tained if the factories that produced the luxuries they craved were 
kept oceans away.36

I do not know enough to judge. The answer lies somewhere 
in the causal mix of individuals reaching individual decisions and 
larger  cultural  and  political  forces.  What  I  know  that  we  can-
not know is what might have happened if the twentieth century 
hadn’t happened the way it did.

Revving Up the Engine of 
Technology-Driven Growth

The world that emerged after 1870 was globalized in a way 

that  it  had  never  been  before.  But  what  exactly  did  that 
mean?  Globalization  was  clearly  something  more  than  just  the 
planet-crossing lines of communication and transportation that 
were beginning to move ideas and people faster than ever before. 
To get a better sense of what globalization meant, we might begin 
by examining the story of Herbert Hoover.1

Hoover was born in 1874 in Iowa. His father, a blacksmith, 
died in 1880, and his mother died in 1884. Herbert was therefore 
orphaned at the age of ten. In 1885 he started moving west—
first to Oregon to live with an aunt and uncle; then, in 1891, 
to California—as he always claimed, to be the first student to 
attend Stanford University (he arrived before opening day, and 
the staff let him sleep on campus). There he studied to become a 
mining engineer, graduating in 1895 in the distressed aftermath 
of the Panic of 1893.

Hoover’s first job was as a mine laborer in Grass Valley, Cal-
ifornia, earning $600 a year. His next was as an intern and spe-
cial assistant to a mining engineer, for which he earned $2,400 a 
year. He kept moving west. In 1897 he crossed the Pacific—first

to Australia, where he worked for the mining company Bewick 
Moreing, earning a salary of $7,000 a year, and then to China, 
where he earned $20,000 a year. It was in China that Hoover 
made  the  first  major  tranche  of  his  fortune,  albeit  in  ways  he 
sometimes found hard to explain later on.2

From  1901  until  1917,  he  lived  in  London,  working  as  a 
consulting engineer and investor, with jobs and investments in 
Australia, China, Russia, Burma, Italy, and Central America in 
addition to the United States. In 1917 he moved back to Amer-
ica, where he was appointed secretary of commerce in 1925 and 
elected president in 1928. From son of the town blacksmith to 
college graduate to multimillionaire mining consultant to presi-
dent of the United States—Had anyone else ascended so far and 
so fast, even in America? It was an exceptional country. And the 
fact that it was exceptional was a significant shaper of how the 
long twentieth century was exceptional.

Hoover, however, did not make the bulk of his fortune from 
globalization.  He  made  it,  rather,  through  his  mastery  of  the 
application of mining technologies, and through his skills as a 
manager and organizer. Globalization was not the most conse-
quential  development  contributing  to  the  watershed  of  1870. 
Between 1870 and 1914, technology and organization improved 
at a rate of 2 percent per year—more than quadruple the pace of 
progress during the previous century, from 1770 to 1870. The 
global economic leaders—initially the United States, Germany, 
and  Britain,  with  Britain  rapidly  falling  off—had  been  grow-
ing faster than the rest of the world even before 1870, perhaps 
0.9 percent per year faster.3 Now, they picked up the pace and 
maintained their lead in growth of perhaps 2.5 percent per year, 
nearly three times as rapid a pace relative to what it had been 
before 1870.

Before  1870,  inventions  and  innovations  had  by  and  large 
been  singular  discoveries  and  adaptations.  They  produced  new 
and better ways of doing old things: of making thread, of weaving

cloth, of carrying goods about, of making iron, of raising coal, 
and of growing wheat and rice and corn. Having pioneered these 
improvements, their inventors then set about finding ways to ex-
ploit  them.  It  was  a  process  that  required  inventors  to  be  not 
just researchers, but development engineers, maintenance techni-
cians, human resource managers, bosses, cheerleaders, marketers, 
impresarios, and financiers as well.

That pre-1870 system was good enough as long as the con-
fluence of circumstances was just right. Consider the invention 
of the steam engine in the eighteenth century. It needed a cheap 
source  of  fuel,  it  needed  something  important  and  profitable 
to  do,  and  it  needed  societal  competence  at  the  metalworking 
technological frontier. Fuel was found at the bottom of the coal 
mines. With the steam engine, cheap, plantation-grown cotton, 
ideally suited for machine spinning, quickly reached factories that 
produced  sought-after  goods.  And  with  practical  metallurgy  to 
make iron rails and iron wheels cheaply, the fuse that was the In-
dustrial Revolution was lit. Steam power propelled the automatic 
spindles,  looms,  metal  presses,  and  railroad  locomotives  of  the 
nineteenth century.

But the fuse might well have sputtered out. That, after all, is 
what the pre-1870 track record would lead one to expect. Print-
ing, the windmill, the musket, the seagoing caravel, the watermill, 
and before that the horse collar, the heavy plow, the 3,600-soldier 
legion—each of these did revolutionize a piece of the economies 
and societies of their day. Yet none of them lit anything like the 
rocket of economic growth we have ridden since 1870. Ancient 
Mediterranean civilization was followed by what is rightly called 
a Dark Age. Printing revolutionized the dissemination of infor-
mation,  but  books  were  always  a  small  part  of  total  spending, 
and the printing press was one revolutionary invention, not a se-
ries of them. The windmill and the watermill meant women no 
longer had to spend so much time nose to grindstone, but their 
fathers and husbands found other things for them to do instead.

The musket and the caravel made the Imperial-Commercial Age 
and the gunpowder empires, but that, again, was a discrete jump 
rather than a take-off into sustained growth. The horse collar and 
the  heavy  plow  shifted  the  center  of  European  settlement  and 
commerce northward, but did not drastically improve the lot of 
Europe’s working class. The legion was essential for the making 
of the Roman Empire, but it then reached the limits of its expan-
sion, and eventually fell.4 What changed after 1870 was that the 
most advanced North Atlantic economies had invented invention. 
They had invented not just textile machinery and railroads, but 
also the industrial research lab and the forms of bureaucracy that 
gave rise to the large corporation. Thereafter, what was invented 
in the industrial research labs could be deployed at national or 
continental  scale.  Perhaps  most  importantly,  these  economies 
discovered that there was a great deal of money to be made and 
satisfaction to be earned by inventing not just better ways of mak-
ing old things, but in making brand-new things.

Not just inventions, but the systematic invention of how to 
invent.  Not  just  individual  large-scale  organizations,  but  orga-
nizing how to organize. Both were essential to the arrival of the 
integrated,  command-and-control  central  planning  of  modern 
corporations. Every year between 1870 and 1914 the newer and 
better industrial technologies that emerged from the first indus-
trial research laboratories were deployed, sometimes as they were 
sold  to  already  established  producers,  but  more  often  as  they 
spurred the emergence and expansion of large corporations.

As W. Arthur Lewis observed, a rich man in 1870 possessed 
the same things that a rich man in 1770 possessed.5 The 1870 rich 
might well have had more of those things—more houses, more 
clothes, more horses and carriages, more furniture. But display-
ing wealth was a matter of displaying the number of servants one 
employed, rather than the commodities one personally enjoyed. 
After the 1870s, that changed. The making of new commodities 
added a new twist, granting the rich access to, as Lewis put it,

“telephones,  gramophones,  typewriters,  cameras,  automobiles, 
and  so  on,  a  seemingly  endless  process  whose  latest  twentieth- 
century additions include æroplanes, radios, refrigerators, wash-
ing machines, television sets, and pleasure boats.” Four percent 
of Americans had flush toilets at home in 1870; 20 percent had 
them in 1920, 71 percent in 1950, and 96 percent in 1970. No 
American had a landline telephone in 1880; 28 percent had one 
in 1914, 62 percent in 1950, and 87 percent in 1970. Eighteen 
percent of Americans had electric power in 1913; 94 percent had 
it by 1950.6

The arrival of these wonders of convenience and consumption 
is often called a “second industrial revolution.” The economist 
Robert Gordon wrote of “one big wave” consisting of everything 
from flush toilets to microwave ovens, after which the low- and 
even  the  moderate-hanging  fruit  of  organic  chemicals,  internal 
combustion  engines,  and  electric  power  had  been  picked  and 
technology was bound to slow. For him, the steady progress of 
science happened to suddenly bring us to a place extraordinarily 
rich in technological potential. But that, I think, misses much of 
the point: we associate these with a single “second industrial rev-
olution” because they came in quick succession: instead of being 
spread out over a century and a half, as they would have been at 
the previous British Industrial Revolution–era pace, they arrived 
in a generation. What is most important is never so much the 
arrival of any particular technology as it is a burgeoning under-
standing that there is a broad and deep range of new technologies 
to be discovered, developed, and deployed.

Consider steel. What would be the fundamental building ma-
terial of the twentieth century and the master metal of industrial 
civilization was effectively invented anew in the second half of 
the 1800s. Steel is composed of 90 to 95 percent iron mixed with 
carbon. You can make carbon-free wrought iron in your furnace 
if you keep its temperature below the melting point of iron and 
hammer it as the slag, or the various impurities in the iron, melt

and run out, and then do this over and over again. But wrought 
iron is too soft for industrial purposes. If you heat your furnace 
with coke, a pure form of coal, and keep it high enough to melt 
the iron, the carbon from the coke alloys with it and you get pig 
or cast iron. But it is too brittle for industrial purposes.

Creating  steel  requires  getting  the  details  just  right—but  

doing so is not easy.

For thousands of years steel was made by skilled craftsmen 
heating and hammering wrought iron in the presence of charcoal 
and then quenching it in water or oil. In the centuries before the 
nineteenth,  making  high-quality  steel  was  a  process  limited  to 
the most skilled blacksmiths of Edo or Damascus or Milan or 
Birmingham. It seemed, to outsiders—and often to insiders—
like magic. In the Germanic legends as modernized in Wagner’s 
Ring cycle operas, the doomed hero Siegfried acquires a sword 
made  by  a  skilled  smith.  Its  maker,  the  dwarf  Mime,  is  in  no 
respect a materials-science engineer. His brother, Alberich, is a 
full magician.7

That  changed  in  1855–1856,  when  Henry  Bessemer  and 
Robert Mushet developed the Bessemer-Mushet process. It forced 
air through the molten cast iron to burn off all non-iron impu-
rities, and then added back just enough carbon (and manganese) 
to make the steel needed for industry. The price of a ton of steel 
dropped by a factor of seven, from £45 down to £6, at a time 
when £70 per year was the average wage in Britain. The Thom-
as-Gilchrist and Siemens-Martin processes followed, offering fur-
ther improvements. Worldwide steel production would rise from 
trivial  amounts—enough  for  swords,  some  cutlery,  and  a  few 
tools that needed the sharpest attainable edge—to some 70 mil-
lion tons a year by 1914.8 By 1950 this would grow to 170 million 
tons, and as of 2020 it is 1.5 billion tons a year. As of 2016, steel 
cost about $500 per ton, and the average North Atlantic full-time 
wage was nearly $50,000 per year.

But it was not just steel. Robert Gordon was 100 percent 
right when he wrote that the year 1870 was the dawn of some-
thing new in the world, for over the next several decades, “every 
aspect of life experienced a revolution. By 1929, urban Amer-
ica  [had]  electricity,  natural  gas,  [the]  telephone,  [and]  clean 
running  water[,] . . . the  horse  had  almost  vanished  from  ur-
ban streets[,] . . . [and] the household . . . enjoy[ed] entertain-
ment[s] . . . beyond the 1870 imagination.”9 From the railroad 
and the steel mill as the high-tech edge of the economy in 1870, 
to the dynamo and the motor car as the high-tech edge in 1903, 
to the assembly line and the aircraft of 1936, to the television 
set and rocket (both moon and military) of 1969, to the micro-
processor and World Wide Web of 2002—technological revo-
lution, with its economic and then its sociological and political 
consequences, problems, and adjustments, came faster and more 
furiously than in any previous age.

Many of these changes came long before 1929. And it was 
not  confined  to  the  United  States.  On  the  1889  centennial  of 
the French Revolution’s storming of the Bastille, France held a 
universal exposition. At the center of it was not some tableau of 
revolutionary martyrs, but a tower designed by and named after 
Gustave Eiffel. As historian Donald Sassoon wrote, the French 
exposition became a “consecrat[ion of] . . . commerce and trade, 
modernity, and the wonders of technology exhibited in the Gal-
erie des Machines. . . . Under the banner of modernity, progress, 
and the peaceful pursuit of wealth, the French people would re-
gain national pride and unity.”10

Eiffel’s steel-built tower, saved from dismantling at the end 
of the universal exposition by a public outcry, has dominated the 
Paris skyline ever since. Across the Atlantic Ocean from Paris, in 
New  York  City’s  harbor,  stood  another  of  Gustave  Eiffel’s  de-
signs. But this steel framework was clothed in copper and called 
the Statue of Liberty.

Life was still hard and dirty. America, rapidly becoming the 
world’s  growth  center  as  the  year  1900  passed,  was  still  poor. 
And it was very unequal. Indeed, but for those Americans held 
in bondage just a few decades earlier, it was more unequal than it 
had ever been before, or than it would be again for the remainder 
of the 1900s.11 Yet the United States in the first decade of the 
1900s was also a very attractive place compared to every single 
other place in the rest of the world. In spite of the long hours and 
the risk of death or injury at the hands of corporations that cared 
little or not at all for worker safety, US jobs were very good ones 
by international standards.12 They were jobs worth moving five 
thousand miles for, from, say, Hungary or Lithuania to suburban 
Pittsburgh or New Jersey.

It is traditional at this point in any economic history to talk 
about  Thomas  Alva  Edison—the  most  famous  inventor  in  the 
world, “the wizard of Menlo Park,” New Jersey, who would reg-
ister more than a thousand patents and found fifteen companies, 
including what is now called General Electric. But Edison’s story 
is already widely known and in fact obscures the global reach of 
the revolution.

Let’s talk instead about another migrant, who, like Herbert 
Hoover, moved west—but in this case someone who moved west 
from Croatia to America: Nikola Tesla.13

Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in the town of Smiljan, in 
the Krajina region of the province of Croatia in the Habsburg 
Empire—then ruled by the young emperor Franz Joseph in Vi-
enna. Tesla was the fourth of five children. His father was liter-
ate—a priest in the Serbian Orthodox Church—but his mother 
was not. His parents wanted him to become a priest. He wanted 
to become an electrical engineer.

Tesla studied electrical engineering in Graz, Austria, for two 
years,  and  then  dropped  out  of  school.  He  broke  off  relations 
with his family and friends, worked as an engineer for two years, 
and apparently suffered a nervous breakdown. His father urged

him to return to college at Prague’s Karl-Ferdinand University. 
Perhaps Nikola did, but if so only for one summer. Around which 
time his father died.

The year 1881 finds Nikola Tesla working in Budapest for a 
startup, the National Telephone Company of Hungary, as chief 
electrician and engineer. But he would not stay for long. In the 
very next year he moved to Paris, where he worked to improve 
and  adapt  American  technology,  and  two  years  after  that,  in  
June 1884, he arrived in New York, New York, with nothing 
in  his  pockets  save  a  letter  of  recommendation  from  engineer 
Charles  Batchelor  to  Thomas  Edison:  “I  know  of  two  great 
men,” Batchelor had written. “You are one of them. This young 
man is the other.” And so Edison hired Tesla.

In America Tesla went to work for Edison Machine Works. 
He would later claim that Edison promised him $50,000—the 
entire net worth at the time of the Edison Machine Works—to 
improve and redesign Edison’s direct current generators. What-
ever was or wasn’t agreed to, in 1885 Edison refused to pay that 
sum. Tesla quit and found himself digging ditches for a living for 
a couple of years.

By his own estimations, Tesla was a difficult man who found 
other men difficult. The day after Edison died, for example, Tesla 
seemed to demonstrate an extraordinary lack of any social intelli-
gence whatsoever as he sketched, for the newspapers, his onetime 
employer and world-renowned inventor thusly: Edison, he said,

had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind 
and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of 
hygiene. . . . His method was inefficient in the extreme, for 
an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all 
unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a 
sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory 
and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the la-
bor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and

mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his in-
ventor’s instinct and practical American sense.14

Of his own personality, Tesla wrote:

I  had  a  violent  aversion  against  the  earrings  of  women . . .  
bracelets pleased me more or less according to design. The 
sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit but I was fasci-
nated with the glitter of crystals. . . . I would get a fever by 
looking at a peach. . . . I counted the steps in my walks and 
calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups and 
pieces of food—otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. All re-
peated acts or operations I performed had to be divisible by 
three and if I missed I felt impelled to do it all over again, 
even if it took hours.15

Tesla  coupled  his  eccentricities  with  bizarre  and  utopian 
claims about the future course of science and technology. He was, 
as  much  as  Mary  Wollstonecraft  Shelley’s  fictional  Dr.  Viktor 
von Frankenstein, the very model of the mad scientist. Unsur-
prisingly, he found it difficult to maintain either financial backers 
or  a  supporting  engineering  staff.  Yet  Tesla  and  his  allies  beat 
Thomas Edison in the struggle over whether electricity was going 
to have an alternating or direct current.

Direct vs. alternating current—what does that mean? Back up 
to the 1770s, and to Alessandro Volta’s discovery of the effects 
produced by a zinc atom’s property that it can step itself down 
to a preferred, lower-energy quantum state by giving up an elec-
tron. Moreover, a silver atom can step itself down to a preferred, 
lower-energy quantum state by accepting an extra electron. Con-
nect an anode to a piece of zinc, and electrons released from the 
zinc will pile up in it. Connect a cathode to a piece of silver, and 
the silver will grab electrons from it. Now run a conducting wire 
from  the  anode  to  the  cathode.  Then  a  direct  current—actual

electrons—will  flow  from  the  anode  to  the  cathode  until  this 
“electrical battery” has run down, which happens when the zinc 
as a whole acquires enough of a positive charge that that charge’s 
attracting electrons offset the strength of the chemical-reaction 
tendency of electrons to leave the zinc. And as the electrons flow 
in a direct current from the anode to the cathode, the energy of 
their motion can be tapped to do work. That is DC—direct cur-
rent—electricity: intuitive and sensible. But its range is small: as 
an electron travels from the anode to the cathode, it bumps and 
jiggles and loses energy to heat with each inch it travels.

Suppose that, instead, you spun a wire near a magnet, so that 
it made one revolution sixty times a second. A stationary electron 
does not notice that it is near a magnet. A moving one does: it 
gets pushed by the magnet with a force proportional to the elec-
tron’s velocity. So as the wire is spun near the magnet, the elec-
trons in it get pushed first one way and then another: shaken sixty 
times a second. Since the wire is a conductor, this shaking gets 
transmitted to pieces of the wire not near the magnet. By wrap-
ping the wire many times around a cylinder, you can turn the 
wire into a very powerful magnet—which can then shake another 
wire  extremely  vigorously  in  this  alternating-current  (AC)  pat-
tern, and this is then a transformer. The more vigorously an elec-
tron is shaken, the greater the efficiency with which the power is 
transmitted—a lower current carries the same energy, and fewer 
electrons means less in the way of heat loss.

Edison’s DC systems therefore required lots of power plants: 
one  per  neighborhood.  Tesla’s  AC  systems  therefore  required 
only a few large power plants, placed where they were most con-
venient, with the power then transmitted via vigorous shaking—
high AC voltage—through long- and short-distance power lines, 
and the degree of the shaking stepped up and stepped down via 
transformers. Economies of scale are thus on Tesla’s side. And 
they are powerful indeed. But this was witchcraft. There was no 
flow of electrons to carry the energy. There was just shaking back

and forth, first one way, then the other. How could shaking with 
no actual movement of electrons from place to place produce use-
ful power? And so there was great resistance, as even trained engi-
neers had a hard time seeing how this could work.16

There was a time, perhaps, when Nikola Tesla was the only 
electrical engineer who understood that power transmission via 
AC was more than a theoretical curiosity, that it would and could 
work  much  more  efficiently,  hence  much  more  cheaply,  than  
Edison’s method.

He  was  right.  Our  entire  electrical  power  grid  and  every-
thing that draws off of it are Tesla’s much more than they are 
Edison’s. The world viewed from space at night, illuminated by 
the  electric  power  grid,  is  Tesla’s  world.  His  ideas  about  how 
to make electrons dance in an efficient and powerful way were 
correct, even though they struck nearly all of his contemporaries 
as highly speculative, unlikely to be practical, and borderline or 
over-the-borderline insane.

Tesla did much, much more. In 1894 he staged perhaps the 
first, or at least one of the first, demonstrations of radio. Many of 
his ideas panned out. Many of his ideas were too many years ahead 
of their time. Many of his ideas were simply mad: death rays and 
broadcast power, for two. He made a huge difference—perhaps 
five to ten years’ worth of difference—in advancing electricity in 
the economy, and may have permanently shifted the economy 
into  a  somewhat  different  direction  from  the  one  in  which  it 
had been heading. How could the mad scientist Tesla make such 
a  difference?  Because  he  could  work  in  industrial  research  labs 
and his ideas could be developed and applied by corporations. 
He could work for George Westinghouse. And General Electric 
could copy what he had done.

Tesla was first, foremost, and finally an inventor. In 1887, he 
founded Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing, but his financial 
backers fired him from his own company. The next year, he staged 
a demonstration of an AC induction motor—the ancestor of all

our current AC motors—at the American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers meeting. And the year after that, he found at last a per-
manent financial backer, George Westinghouse and his Westing-
house Electric and Manufacturing Company. Tesla soon began 
working at the company’s laboratory in Pittsburg. In 1891, at the 
age of thirty-five, Tesla was back in New York establishing his own 
laboratory with money he’d made by selling his patents to West-
inghouse under a patent-sharing agreement. In 1892 he became 
vice  president  of  the  American  Institute  of  Electrical  Engineers 
and  received  patents  for  the  polyphase  AC  electric  power  sys-
tem he invented. In 1893 he and George Westinghouse used AC 
power to illuminate the Chicago World’s Fair—the first World’s 
Fair ever to have a building for electricity and its applications.

The late 1880s and 1890s saw Westinghouse and Tesla and 
their backers struggle against Edison and his backers in the so-
called “war of the currents.” Edison had bet on a DC electrical 
grid. Direct current worked very well with incandescent lamps 
and with the motors of the day. It worked well with storage bat-
teries, which meant that you only had to build the expensive gen-
erating  capacity  for  average  loads  rather  than  peak  loads.  And 
Edison  had  not  fully  comprehended  what  Tesla  was  getting  at 
when  Tesla  worked  for  him:  “[Tesla’s]  ideas  are  splendid,”  he 
said. “But they are utterly impractical.”17

The AC systems of Tesla and Westinghouse allowed the effi-
cient transmission of electrical power over long distances through 
high-voltage power lines. Once the energy got where you wanted 
it to go, it could then be reduced, via step-down transformers, to 
a voltage that wasn’t immediately fatal. Edison’s DC system was 
far less risky, though it required low voltage to be pushed across 
long distances, incurring extremely large resistance power losses. 
On the one hand, Tesla’s system, with all its attendant risks, got 
more energy where you wanted it. On the other, it was not ob-
vious how alternating current could be used to power anything 
useful. Until, that is, Tesla invented the induction motor.

Both Westinghouse and Edison nearly bankrupted themselves 
as each struggled to build out an electrical power grid fast enough 
to become the dominant standard. Westinghouse and Tesla won.
The reach of Tesla’s ideas was vastly expanded by the wealth 
and organizational intelligence of others and continued to expand 
even after Tesla, in 1899, moved from New York to Colorado 
Springs to conduct experiments in high-voltage power distribu-
tion—both through wires and wireless. His wireless power distri-
bution experiments soon turned into radio, an outcome in which 
he  had  limited  interest.  Tesla  was  instead  captivated  with  the 
idea of distributing electric power throughout the world without 
having to build power lines, and in distributing electric power for 
free. His was a kind of open-source electric power movement that 
antedated the open-source software movement by ninety years.

Dominant  financiers  J.  P.  Morgan  and  George  F.  Baker 
decided in 1907, when that year’s financial panic, plus George 
Westinghouse’s  having  unwisely  borrowed  too  much  money 
from  them,  gave  them  the  opportunity,  that  the  heroic  age  of 
electricity was over. It was time, Morgan decided, to rationalize 
operations and replace visionary inventors like Tesla (and wild-
eyed, charismatic entrepreneurs like George Westinghouse, who 
would  back  him)  with  sober,  flannel-suited  executives,  such  as 
Robert Mather and Edwin F. Atkins, who would routinize the 
business. They focused on the bottom line: spend less on blue-
sky experiments, pay workers less, and channel free cash flow not 
into overseas expansion or (horrors!) into competing with banker 
favorite General Electric, but into dividends. Tesla gave Westing-
house  a  perpetual  royalty-free  license  to  use  all  his  inventions, 
and so impoverished himself. Morgan and Baker pushed West-
inghouse out anyway, and kept the license.18

Tesla  was  not  alone  in  straddling  the  end  of  the  short 
nineteenth  century  and  the  start  of  the  long  twentieth.  As  a 
creative, inventive genius he kept rare company, but as a post- 
Westinghouse charity case of the Waldorf-Astoria in New York

City, his impoverishment meant he kept vast company, for the 
world then was still a poor one.

In 1914 perhaps two-thirds of nearly all humans still tilled 
the earth to grow the bulk of the food their families ate. Most hu-
mans could not read; nor had they seen a steam engine up close, 
traveled on a railway train, spoken on a telephone, or lived in a 
city. Life expectancy was still little higher than it had been in the 
Agrarian Age. And in 1914, even in the United States, more than 
one-third of the labor force worked in agriculture. At the time, the 
United States was a beacon to the world’s toiling millions, who 
were often willing to move continents to improve their lot. Of all 
the countries of the world, only Britain and Belgium were mov-
ing their workers out of agriculture and into the cities faster than 
America was. Consider that early in the first decade of the 1900s 
Germany became the world’s third superpower, more powerful 
and more industrialized than any other nation save Britain and 
the United States. But by the time Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany 
went to war in 1939, four-fifths of the wheeled and tracked vehi-
cles in his army were still powered by horses and mules.19

To get a better sense of not just how poor but how unequal 
a society the United States was at the beginning of the twenti-
eth century, consider the case of an anonymous college professor, 
who in 1902 was the subject of a four-page article for the Atlantic 
Monthly under the byline of G.H.M.20 The professor, claiming to 
be vastly underpaid, asserted, with pique, that the “average col-
lege professor’s salary” was “about $2,000.” He saw this as clearly 
inadequate and unfairly low. Yet, at the time, $2,000 was roughly 
four times the average American worker’s gross production and 
six times his annual wage. For comparison’s sake, in 2020 a pro-
fessor earning four times the national average would command an 
annual salary of $500,000.21

But G.H.M. saw himself as a “reasonable man.” He did not 
ask for “a large [salary], commensurate with what equal ability 
would bring in other lines of work ($10,000 to $50,000)”—or

twenty to one hundred times the nation’s then current average 
income per worker.

Yet the Atlantic Monthly did not give this ordinary professor 
four pages for parody. As G.H.M. went through his budget, read-
ers nodded in agreement that his family was indeed strapped for 
cash. The ﬁrst large expense he listed was for personal services. 
With no consumer durables—refrigerators, washers and dryers, 
oven ranges powered by an electric grid or municipal gas, not to 
mention cars and home appliances—“we must pay $25 a month 
for even a passable servant,” the prof wrote. Add to that $10 a 
month for laundry, for the regular servants would “do no laundry 
work,” he complained. And then $1 a month for haircuts, and 
$2 a month for a gardener. On personal services alone we are up 
to $445 a year—roughly the average level of US gross domestic 
product (GDP) per worker in 1900. And the individuals hired to 
help did so without benefit of a gasoline-powered lawnmower, 
electric hedge clippers, a vacuum cleaner, or a dishwasher.

Professor  G.H.M.  could  not  afford  to  live  within  walking 
distance  of  campus,  and  could  not  afford  to  keep  a  horse  and 
carriage, so he had to use that newfangled high-tech invention—
the bicycle—to commute. That an ordinary professor could feel, 
along  with  a  reading  public,  that  his  talents  should  command 
such  an  enormous  multiple  of  the  average  income,  and  worry 
about its insufficiency, is a sign of the deeply stratified economy 
in which he found himself.

That inequality comes into sharp relief when we turn our at-
tention from this average professor to the average working-class 
family at the start of the twentieth century.

Perhaps a third of American households in 1900 had board-
ers, almost always male and unrelated, sleeping and eating in the 
house. It was the only way for the housewife to bring income di-
rectly into the household. It also multiplied the amount of labor 
she had to do. Much of it was manual. For example, few house-
holds  had  running  water  or  a  hot  water  heater.  Instead,  water

came in by the bucket from a common faucet that was, hopefully, 
near the house, and for washing it was then heated on a wood- 
or coal-burning stove. The same absence of durable goods that 
cursed our professor damned our housewife, from heating that 
stove to cleaning a shirt.22

Those who could afford the resources to maintain bourgeois 
styles of cleanliness flaunted it. White shirts, white dresses, and 
white gloves were all powerful indications of wealth at the turn 
of twentieth-century America. They said, “I don’t have to do my 
own laundry,” and they said it loudly.

The relatively prosperous steel factory town of Homestead, 
Pennsylvania,  provides  further  insight  into  the  vast  disparities 
of  wealth  at  the  time.  In  1910,  only  one  in  six  working-class 
households had indoor bathrooms. Half of “Slav” and “Negro” 
families lived in one- or two-room houses. Most white families 
lived  in  four-room  houses—and  many  groups  that  would  be 
called “white” today were not considered to be so then, including 
“Slavs,” “Latins,” and “Hebrews.” But even in the relative com-
fort of a four-room house, few could afford to heat more than one 
room through a Pennsylvania winter. And how many ways can 
you think of to cook potatoes on an antique cast-iron stove? Meal 
preparation was not a one-hour-a-day but a four-hour-a-day task.
Infant mortality was still high. One in ﬁve babies in Home-
stead, Pennsylvania, died before reaching his or her ﬁrst birthday. 
Adult women faced substantial risks in childbirth. And adult men 
died, too, like flies. Accident rates in the Homestead factory left 
260 injured per year and 30 dead. This out of a total population 
of  25,000  and  a  steel  mill  working  population  of  5,000.  Each 
year, 5 percent of those 5,000 workers were injured sufficiently 
in factory accidents to miss work, 1 percent were permanently 
disabled, and half a percent were killed.

We can do the math. If you had started to work for U.S. Steel 
when you were twenty, there was then a chance of one in seven 
that the factory would have killed you before you reached fifty,

and of almost one in three that it would have disabled you. Is it 
any wonder that life insurance and disability insurance provided 
by local lodges and organizations (because the company provided 
few)  loomed  so  large  in  American  working-class  consciousness 
at the turn of the century? Is it any wonder that Homestead was 
home to some of the most violent and brutal labor disputes of 
the late nineteenth century, exceeded in viciousness only by the 
mines of the Rocky Mountains and the railroad marshaling yards 
of Chicago? And is it any wonder that the ﬁrst component of the 
welfare state put into place in many parts of the United States was 
workmen’s compensation?

Most  of  the  Homestead  workforce  only  worked  six  days  a 
week. That “only” was hard won, for U.S. Steel viewed shutting 
most of the mill on Sundays as a major concession on their part, 
one  its  principals  hoped  would  produce  large  public  relations 
beneﬁts. As long as they could ﬁnd workers willing to work the 
night shift, the Homestead mill (depressions and recessions apart) 
stayed  open  twenty-four  hours  a  day  on  weekdays.  And  when 
things changed, they changed all at once—from two twelve-hour 
shifts, before and during World War I, to two (or three) eight-
hour shifts during the 1920s, World War II, and thereafter.

Yet Homestead jobs—at least Homestead jobs taken by peo-
ple born in the United States—were good jobs for the time, even 
by the elevated standards of the United States. Most who held 
those jobs were grateful. “Their expectations were not ours,” his-
torian Ray Ginger explained. “A man who grew up on a Southern 
farm did not think it cruel that his sons had to work as bobbin 
boys [collecting spun thread in a textile mill]. An immigrant liv-
ing in a tenement and working in a sweatshop yet knew that for 
the ﬁrst time in his life he was wearing shoes seven days a week.”23 
White households in Homestead could make around $900 a year, 
which placed them well within the upper third of the US popula-
tion in terms of income per household, in the richest country in 
the world save for Australia.

Relative  to  what  could  be  earned  by  people  of  similar  skill 
levels anywhere else in the world, a job in the Homestead mill 
was a very attractive job. And so people came to America, and 
people in America sought out the places like Homestead where 
the economy bustled.

The sources of America’s exceptional wealth were many.
By  1870  the  focus  of  economic  growth  crossed  the  Atlan-
tic from Britain to America, where, on a continent-wide scale, a 
flood of immigration, vast resources, and an open society made 
inventors and entrepreneurs cultural heroes.

Some have noted that the country’s vast size and population 
induced industries that could embrace mass production and mod-
ern management. Some have noted the great tide of immigrants 
who turned to America, bringing with them labor, talent, and a 
willingness to work and consume. Still others have stressed the 
crucial role played by natural resources in America’s industrial su-
premacy: in a world in which transport costs were still significant, 
a comparative advantage in natural resources became a compar-
ative advantage in manufacturing. Others have stressed the links 
between a resource-rich economy and the “American system” of 
manufactures, relying on standardization, attempts to make in-
terchangeable parts, heavy use of machinery—and wasteful use of 
natural resources, including both materials and energy. Finally, 
some  have  stressed  the  openness  of  American  society,  the  ease 
with which individuals, ideas, capital, and initiative moved across 
the continent, and across other continents and back again.24

It  was  a  system  of  opportunities  in  which  a  Hoover  and  a 
Tesla, not to mention a Westinghouse, an Edison, a professor go-
ing by the initials G.H.M., and a Homestead laborer, could feel 
hopeful and be ambitious. But calling it a “system” is too grandi-
ose, suggesting some farsighted process. In the twentieth century 
these collective sources of exceptional wealth led to possibilities 
of mass production not because of any deliberative, planned pro-
cess of industrial development, but through myopic choices that

generated further technological externalities. The invention of in-
venting, it turns out, produces yet more inventions.

To  which  we  can  add  two  additional  sources  of  American 
wealth:  education  and  peace,  though  we  must  note  that  these 
were  largely  unavailable  to  both  the  Indigenous  peoples—First 
Nations—descendants of earlier immigrants by land rather than 
later ones by sea—who were then being exposed to diseases via 
“gifts”  of  blankets  and  herded  onto  reservations,  and  Blacks, 
against whom white society was then waging a campaign of terror.
In  America  in  1914,  even  in  rural  America,  children  went 
to school. The years before World War I saw a large increase in 
education, as at least elementary school became the rule for chil-
dren in leading-edge economies. And the number of years that a 
typical student attended school grew as well.25

The United States made the creation of a literate, numerate 
citizenry a high priority. And that encouraged those with richer 
backgrounds, better preparations, and quicker or better-trained 
minds to go on to ever higher education. Industrialists and others 
soon found the higher quality of their workforce more than mak-
ing up for the taxes levied to support mass secondary and higher 
education.  This  was  not  a  unique  American  advantage.  While 
the United States’ strong educational system provided an edge in 
productivity, Britain’s Dominions, and even more so Germany, 
also had a strong commitment to education and enjoyed a similar 
advantage in industrial competitiveness.

American exceptionalism was very real, but can blur a point: 
the country was exceptional compared to the rest of the developed 
Western world only by degrees. Cumulatively, the differences by 
degree, however, added up to something that to many appearances 
was a difference in kind. And the end result was a United States 
that enjoyed a remarkable extent of technological and industrial 
dominance over the rest of the world for much of the twentieth 
century. It also captured much of the world’s imagination.

Because it was in relative terms so prosperous, and because 
its gradient of technological advance in the pre–World War I pe-
riod was so much faster than that of Western Europe, the United 
States was where people looked to see the shape of the dawning 
twentieth century. In the seventeenth century, much of Europe 
had looked to Holland; in the nineteenth, much of the world had 
looked to Britain. As the long twentieth century began, almost 
the entire world, and certainly all of Europe, looked to America. 
To observers it appeared to be a qualitatively different civilization. 
The United States lacked the burden of the past that constrained 
the politics and oppressed the peoples of Europe, and, freed from 
that burden, it could look boldly toward the future.

The  unique  American  advantage  was  greatly  reinforced  by 
the fact that in the United States, the period of explosive pros-
perity set in motion around 1870 (also called the Belle Époque, 
the Gilded Age, or the economic El Dorado) lasted without in-
terruption longer than elsewhere in the world. China collapsed 
into revolution in 1911. Europe descended into the hell of World 
War  I  in  1914.  In  the  United  States,  the  period  of  progress  
and industrial development lasted from 1865, when the guns fell 
silent at Appomattox at the end of the Civil War, until the start 
of the Great Depression in the summer of 1929.

We can see some of the admiration and wonder that turn-of-
the-century America triggered by gazing at the country through 
the eyes of yet another migrant: Lev Davidovich Bronstein.

Lev’s parents had also been migrants: his father, David, and 
mother,  Anna,  crossed  the  greatest  river  they  had  ever  seen  to 
move  hundreds  of  miles  out  of  the  forest  and  into  the  grass-
lands—lands where the horse nomads had roamed within recent 
historical memory before their suppression by the army. There 
they lived on what were among the richest agricultural soils in 
the world, and very thinly settled. It was fifteen miles from the 
Bronsteins’ farm to the nearest post office.

But this is not Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie, 
a story of the European settlement of the wheatlands of America. 
The Bronstein farm was in Yanovka, in Ukraine. The languages 
they spoke were Russian and Yiddish, not English. When they 
sent their son Lev to school by sending him to the nearest big city, 
it was not the Lake Michigan port city of Chicago, but the Black 
Sea port city of Odessa.

There he became a communist. And midway through his ca-
reer he found himself feared by czars and policemen, and hunted 
and exiled because he was feared. In January 1917 he began a ten-
week stay in New York City with his family (his second wife and 
their children). Unlike most of the people who had left the Old 
World for the New and wound up in New York in the 1910s, the 
communist Lev did not want to be there. But he and his family 
made the best of it, and he later wrote about their life in the city:

We rented an apartment in a workers’ district, and furnished 
it on the installment plan. That apartment, at eighteen dollars 
a  month,  was  equipped  with  all  sorts  of  conveniences  that 
we Europeans were quite unused to: electric lights, gas cook-
ing-range,  bath,  telephone,  automatic  service-elevator,  and 
even a chute for the garbage. These things completely won 
the boys over to New York. For a time the telephone was their 
main  interest;  we  had  not  had  this  mysterious  instrument   
either in Vienna or Paris.

They—particularly the children—were overwhelmed by the 
prosperity of the United States and by the technological marvels 
that they saw in everyday use:

The children had new friends. The closest was the chauffeur 
of Dr. M. The doctor’s wife took my wife and the boys out 
driving[;] . . . the chauffeur was a magician, a titan, a super-
man! With a wave of his hand, he made the machine obey

his slightest command. To sit beside him was the supreme 
delight.

When  the  Russian  Revolution  came,  Lev  returned  to  St.  
Petersburg, a city that would change its name several times over 
the long twentieth century, first to Petrograd, then to Leningrad, 
and finally back to St. Petersburg. Fittingly, Lev would change 
his name, too. He took an alias from one of his former czarist 
jailers in Odessa: Lev Bronstein became Leon Trotsky.

Trotsky was never allowed back into the United States. He 
was, after all, a dangerous subversive, with a long-run plan that 
included the overthrow of the government of the United States 
by force and violence. He became Lenin’s right hand, the orga-
nizer of Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War, the ﬁrst of 
the losers to Joseph Stalin in the subsequent power struggle, and 
ﬁnally the victim of the Soviet secret police, assassinated with an 
ice pick in his head outside Mexico City in 1940.

Before  his  murder,  while  in  exile,  Trotsky  would  recall  his 
departure from New York City. And in doing so he would cap-
ture what much of the world believed. In leaving New York for 
Europe, Trotsky felt, he was leaving the future for the past: “I was 
leaving for Europe, with the feeling of a man who has had only a 
peek into the furnace where the future is being forged.”26

Utopia was being built, Trotsky thought. But it was not being 
built in the Russian Empire to which he was returning to try to 
take  advantage  of  the  political  moment  opened  by  the  abdica-
tion of Czar Nicholas II Romanov. It was the United States that 
was holding high the banner of utopia, and promising to be the 
world’s leader and guide along the path.

The heat for this forge came from recurring waves of tech-
nological  advance  that  kept  coming  at  an  unprecedented  pace. 
These waves were created by the industrial research lab and the 
modern  corporation,  and  though  they  were  America-centered, 
they diffused outward, first to the rest of the global north and

then, slowly, throughout the world: remember, there was more 
proportional  techno-economic  progress  and  change  in  a  single 
year over the 1870–2010 period than in fifty years before 1500, 
and  more  than  in  twelve  years  over  the  period  from  1500  to 
1770, or more than in four years over 1770–1870. This progress 
created much, and it also destroyed much. Remember, this is a 
market economy we are talking about: the financing to keep your 
job existing requires that it be part of a value chain that satisfies 
some  maximum-probability  test  carried  out  by  some  financier 
who may be thousands of miles away; your ability to earn the in-
come you think you deserve depends on your potential employers 
scrutinizing the value of what you can do by the same metric. As 
technological capabilities grow, the ability of those whose work 
relies  on  old  technologies  to  pass  such  tests  declines.  “Capital-
ism,” economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote in 1942, “never can 
be stationary. . . . The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps 
the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ 
goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new 
markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist 
enterprise creates. . . . Industrial mutation . . . incessantly revolu-
tionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroy-
ing  the  old  one. . . . This  process  of  creative  destruction  is  the 
essential fact about capitalism.”27 Great wealth is created by the 
creation. Poverty is imposed by the destruction. And uncertainty 
and anxiety are created by the threat. Someone had to manage 
this process, to contain rebellions against the consequences of the 
“destruction” part if the future of technological possibilities was 
in fact to be forged.

After  2006,  the  pace  of  measured  economic  growth  in  the 
United States was to plummet. In 2010, our ending date, many 
thought this was a flash in the pan, because 2010 came just after 
the nadir of the Great Recession that had begun in 2008. But 
over  the  entire  decade  of  2006–2016,  measured  real  GDP  per 
capita grew at a pace of only 0.6 percent per year—a shocking

falloff from anything that had been seen earlier in the long twen-
tieth century. Over the 1996–2006 decade, the pace had been 2.3 
percent per year. Over the two decades before that, 1976–1996, 
the pace had been 2 percent per year, and in the “Thirty Glorious 
Years” after World War II it had been 3.4 percent per year. After 
2006, exceptional America’s furnace’s fires were rapidly cooling, 
if not out, or not yet out.

Democratizing  
the Global North

There is a big difference between the economic and the politi-

cal economic. The latter term refers to the methods by which 
people collectively decide how they are going to organize the rules 
of the game within which economic life takes place. It therefore 
relates to how people collectively decide to establish the rules by 
which they make decisions about organization and institutions. 
To see how political economy works in practice, let’s jump back 
in time, to the start of the story of the federal government of the 
United States.

James Madison was never enthusiastic about democracy. He 
wrote, in the Federalist Papers in 1787, “Democracies have ever 
been  spectacles  of  turbulence  and  contention;  have  ever  been 
found incompatible with personal security or the rights of prop-
erty;  and  have  been . . . as  short  in  their  lives  as . . . violent  in 
their deaths.”1

Then again, in the late 1700s next to nobody among the rich 

and powerful was enthusiastic about democracy.

What James Madison was enthusiastic about was a republic, 
a system of government in which a certain subset of people who 
counted—consisting, for the most part, of those already endowed 

85

with healthy amounts of security and property—would choose a 
small, select group of the wise, thoughtful, and energetic to rep-
resent them. These representatives would share the values of the 
people and advance their well-being, but, it was hoped, would 
do so disinterestedly: seeking not their own profit but rather to 
demonstrate their virtue as citizens.

Madison fervently wanted to avoid the “turbulence and con-
tention” of democracy. Recall that under the Constitution Mad-
ison and his peers drew up, states could restrict the franchise as 
much as they wished, as long as they preserved “a republican form 
of government.”

America’s Founding Fathers had their work cut out for them 
convincing anyone that even their limited-franchise republic was 
a good idea. At the time, feudal webs, monarchies, and empires 
seemed to be the more durable and quite likely the better forms 
of government. As of 1787, Madison and Alexander Hamilton, 
in the Federalist Papers, were reduced to arguing that establishing 
a republic was worth risking, in spite of its sorry historical past, 
because of “advances in the science of government” since classi-
cal antiquity. But Thomas Jefferson, for one, thought Hamilton 
at least was just “talking his book,” because he had committed 
himself out of ambition to the revolutionary republican cause—
that privately Hamilton wished for a monarchical form of gov-
ernment for America.2 Back then, democracy’s superiority wasn’t 
so obvious.

Yet from 1776 to 1965, democracy—at least in the form of 
one male, of the right age and race, one vote—made huge strides 
in  the  North  Atlantic.  The  feudal  and  monarchical  systems  of 
government fell into ever greater disrepute.

For a while, prosperity was seen as the most important qualifi-
cation for political participation. Up until the end of World War 
I, in the Prussian provincial legislature of the German Empire, 
those who paid the top one-third of taxes got to elect one-third of 
the representatives. In the early 1840s, François Guizot, a slightly

left-of-center  prime  minister  in  France’s  constitutional  monar-
chy, responded to demands for a broader electoral franchise with 
the words enrichessez vous: if you want to vote, get rich enough 
to qualify. It did not work. On February 23, 1848, King Louis- 
Philippe,  of  France’s  Orleanist  dynasty—the  only  king  of  the  
Orleanist dynasty—threw Guizot under the proverbial horse-cart 
in the hope of avoiding revolution and dethronement. Too little, 
too late. Louis-Philippe abdicated the following day.3

Over  the  period  1870–1914,  expanding  democracy  proved 
to  be  the  political  principle  that  caused  the  least  offense  to  the 
greatest number, and it consequently gained general acceptance. 
Political  society  would  be  a  realm  in  which  some  or  most  of  
the male individuals’ preferences would count equally in choosing 
the government, and government would then curb and control 
the economy somewhat. It would limit but not extinguish the ex-
tra influence of those whom Theodore Roosevelt called the “male-
factors of great wealth.”

But  even  this  was  not  enough  to  satisfy  everyone—indeed, 

there would be ongoing pressure to expand the franchise.

When liberals were in power, they tried to extend the suf-
frage on the principle that new, poorer voters would be less con-
servative and would support them. When conservatives were in 
power, they (more rarely and reluctantly) tried to extend the suf-
frage in the belief that workers, loyal to king and country, would 
support  them.  Allowing  more  people  to  vote  would  “dish  the 
[liberal] Whigs,” for the workers would remember who had and 
who had not succeeded in giving them the franchise.4 And when 
revolution threatened, governments, fearing armed mobs in the 
streets, would extend the franchise to divide the potentially revo-
lutionary opposition. “The Principle,” then prime minister Earl 
Grey said in an 1831 debate over Britain’s franchise- extension 
reform bill, “is to prevent . . . revolution,” and on the basis of 
that expectation he declared, “I am reforming to preserve, not to 
overthrow.”5

By such means did the suffrage creep forward, step by step, 
under liberal and conservative regimes. Up until 1914, at least 
in the increasingly prosperous North Atlantic industrial core of 
the world economy, the prospects for spreading broad prosperity 
and stabilizing democracy looked good. The politico-economic 
system  seemed  to  be  working:  the  rising  prosperity  made  aris-
tocrats and plutocrats feel that the slow erosion of their relative 
social position was a price worth paying for the good things they 
received, and made those lower down feel that their continued 
toleration  of  upper-class  dominance  was  a  price  worth  paying 
for societal progress. Finally, conservatives and liberals saw wide 
enough  paths  to  political  victory  to  make  both  confident  that  
the current trajectory of history was on their side.

While suffrage expanded quickly in many respects, it came 
in fits and starts, and a much longer time passed before it was 
extended to women.

In 1792, France became the first country to grant universal 
male suffrage—although effective suffrage of any kind was gone 
by the time of Napoleon’s coronation in 1804, and universal male 
suffrage did not return, save for a brief interval in 1848–1851, 
until 1871. In the United States the fight for the franchise for 
white men had been won around 1830. The first European state 
to offer universal suffrage—for both men and women—was Fin-
land in 1906. In Great Britain (near) universal suffrage came in 
1918, when the suffrage was extended to all men twenty-one and 
older and to women thirty and older. Adult women under thirty 
had to wait until 1928.

American suffragettes fought the good fight for decades. By 
the  early  1900s  it  was  ongoing.  In  their  ranks  was  my  great- 
grandmother,  Florence  Wyman  Richardson,  who,  with  others, 
chained herself to the statehouse fence in Missouri’s capital, and 
as a consequence reportedly got herself expelled from the St. Louis 
Veiled Prophet Debutante Society. The Nineteenth Amendment 
to  the  Constitution  extending  the  vote  to  all  women  passed  in

1920. France, having led in the late 1800s, was the laggard. Not 
until the expulsion of the of the Vichy Nazi collaborationist re-
gime in 1944 did it extend the vote to women.

It took even longer for the extension of the franchise to cross 

the race line, especially in the United States.

Events  involving  heroic  sacrifices  of  every  sort  played  out 
over more than a century during the fight for the right of Blacks 
to vote. Among these were the Colfax Massacre in Louisiana in 
1873,  during  which  approximately  one  hundred  Blacks  were 
murdered. At a much less heroic end of the spectrum, when my 
great-grandmother Florence joined others to launch the Urban 
League in St. Louis in the 1920s, she became the scandal of her 
neighborhood by inviting Black people to dinner.

The enfranchisement of Blacks would not truly come in the 
United  States  until  1965,  with  passage  of  the  Voting  Rights 
Act—and even thereafter, it remained tenuous. As I write this 
paragraph, one-third of US states have recently crafted bureau-
cratic and legal obstacles aimed at differentially disenfranchising 
up to one-fourth of Black voters. No less august, at least institu-
tionally, a person as the late Supreme Court chief justice William 
Rehnquist won his spurs by running “ballot security” efforts, in 
the early 1960s, in which “every Black or Mexican[-looking] per-
son was being challenged.” Why did he do this? As one witness 
reported: “[As] a deliberate effort to slow down the voting . . .  
to cause people awaiting their turn to vote to grow tired of wait-
ing,  and  leave . . . handbills  were  distributed  warning  persons 
that if they were not properly qualified to vote they would be 
prosecuted.”6

FROM MADISON TO REHNQUIST and beyond, it has ever been 
the  case  that  for  some  segment  of  humanity,  democracy—and 
the right to vote, and the consequent exercise of influence and 
power—raised  more  questions  than  they  solved.  Of  this  richly

braided material Gordian knots were tied, repeatedly, and efforts 
to sever them commanded the spilling of gallons of ink, and of 
even more of blood.

The history of these conflicts over democracy has intersected 
in important ways with economic history. To understand how, 
let us turn again to two Vienna-born thinkers whom I have al-
ready  mentioned:  the  Austrian-British-Chicagoan  right-wing 
economist  Friedrich  August  von  Hayek  (1899–1992),  and  the 
slightly older Hungarian-Jewish-Torontonian moral philosopher 
Karl Polanyi (1886–1964).

We first give the floor to Hayek, driven always to teacheth the 
lesson that “the market giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be 
the name of the market.”

In Hayek’s view, to inquire whether a market economy’s dis-
tribution of income and wealth was “fair” or “just” was to com-
mit  a  fatal  intellectual  blunder.  “Justice”  and  “fairness”  of  any 
form require that you receive what you deserve. A market econ-
omy gives not to those who deserve, but to those who happen to 
be in the right place at the right time. Who controls the resources 
that are valuable for future production is not a matter of fairness. 
Once you step into the morass of “social justice,” Hayek believed, 
you would not be able to stop chasing a “just” and “fair” outcome 
“until the whole of society was organized . . . in all essential re-
spects . . . [as] the opposite of a free society.”7

Note that this did not mean you were morally obligated to 
watch the poor starve and the injured bleed out and die in the 
street. Society should make “some provision for those threatened 
by the extremes of indigence or starvation due to circumstances 
beyond their control,” Hayek said, if only as the cheapest way to 
protect hardworking and successful folks “against acts of desper-
ation on the part of the needy.” But beyond that you should not 
interfere with the market. The market was, or would lead us to, 
utopia—or as close to utopia as humans could attain. Interfer-
ence was therefore worse than inexpedient.8

That a market economy can produce a highly unequal distri-
bution of income and wealth just as it can produce a less unequal 
distribution of income and wealth was beside the point. To even 
raise the question of what the distribution of wealth should be 
was to presume—falsely, Hayek believed—that people had rights 
other than property rights, and obligations to others beyond those 
they freely assumed through contract.

Besides,  rectifying  inequality  was  awful  because  it  was  chi-
merical.  Hayek  believed  we  lacked  and  would  always  lack  the 
knowledge  to  create  a  better  society.  Centralization  always  led 
to misinformation and bad decisions. Top-down was a disaster. 
Only bottom-up “spontaneous order,” which emerged from ev-
eryone pursuing their own self-interest in what might seem to be 
a chaotic process, could possibly lead to progress.

To that end, what humanity had was market capitalism, the 
only system that could possibly be even moderately efficient and 
productive,  for  “prices  are  an  instrument  of  communication 
and guidance which embody more information than we directly 
have,” Hayek wrote, and so “the whole idea that you can bring 
about the same order based on the division of labor by simple 
direction falls to the ground.” Any attempts to reorder the mar-
ket distribution of income in order to reward the deserving at 
the expense of the undeserving would erode market capitalism: 
“The idea [that] you can arrange for distributions of incomes . . .  
correspond[ing] to . . . merit or need,” he said, does not fit with 
your “need [for] prices, including the prices of labor, to direct 
people to go where they are needed.” And once you start top-
down planning, you are on what he called “the road to serfdom,” 
and “the detailed scale of values which must guide the planning 
makes  it  impossible  that  it  should  be  determined  by  anything 
like democratic means.”9 Hayek’s was a “this-is-as-good-as-it-is-
ever-going-to-get” sort of utopianism.

Hayek understood, however, that this better method of or-
ganizing society that cared not a whit for fairness and justice was

unlikely to be accepted with universal cries of “huzzah!” That the 
only rights the market economy recognizes are property rights—
and  indeed,  only  those  property  rights  that  are  valuable— 
predictably didn’t inspire the multitudes. It was clear that peo-
ple  thought  they  had  other  rights  beyond  those  that  accrued 
to the property they happened to hold. And this feeling posed 
an enormous problem for Hayek. To his credit, he didn’t shy 
away from the direction his arguments led. He identified two 
substantive enemies to a good (or at least as good as it is likely 
to get) society: egalitarianism and permissiveness. Too much de-
mocracy—democracy that made people feel that they should be 
able to do what they wanted and not be lorded over by those 
with more property—was, in short, bad.

Indeed, for Hayek, egalitarianism was “a product of the ne-
cessity under unlimited democracy to solicit the support even of 
the worst.” In other words, democracy essentially meant conced-
ing, as he put it, “‘a right to equal concern and respect’ to those 
who break the code”—which, he warned, was no way to maintain 
a civilization.10

The fearsome result for Hayek would then be permissiveness, 
which, “assisted by a scientistic psychology,” he wrote, “has come 
to the support of those who claim a share in the wealth of our 
society without submitting to the discipline to which it is due.” 
The lesson was clear. A prosperous market economy could only 
flourish if it was protected by authority.

For  Hayek,  overly  democratic,  egalitarian,  and  permissive 
societies  would  probably  need  at  some  point  someone  to  seize 
power  and  reorder  the  society  in  an  authoritarian  mode  that 
would respect the market economy. Such an interruption would 
be a temporary “Lykourgan moment,” as he called it—using a 
term  harking  back  to  the  mythical  ordainer  of  the  laws  of  the 
classical Greek city of Sparta—and afterward, the music could re-
start and the normal dance of ordered individual liberty and mar-
ket-driven prosperity resume. Hayek, standing on the shoulders

of giants and tyrants alike, articulated a position about the market 
economy that throughout the twentieth century would turn the 
political right against democracy again and again, leading a great 
many to view the institution not just as a lesser good, but as a 
genuine evil. These views did not lose strength as World War I 
drew near.

Now the paragraphs above have cast a harsh light on Hayek’s 
thought as a moral philosopher and political activist. And, later 
on, I will make even harsher judgments of Hayek’s thought as a 
macroeconomist. Why, then, should we not ignore him? There 
are three main reasons.

First, he serves as a marker for an extremely influential cur-
rent of thought and action, influential not least because it found 
itself congenial to and backed by the rich and powerful.

Second, Hayek’s political economy is not completely wrong. 
The democratic political sphere can turn into one in which the 
logic is not cooperation and growth but rather confiscation and 
redistribution—with “deserving” and “undeserving” standing in, 
respectively, for the friends and enemies of the powerful. Hayek 
is  not  wrong  that  keeping  your  head  down,  concentrating  on 
win-win production for market exchange, and ignoring appeals 
to “social justice” as chimerical can be vastly better than such a 
scenario.

Third, Hayek was a farsighted genius Dr. Jekyll in one cru-
cially important aspect of his thinking—he was a hedgehog who 
knew one very good trick, as Isaiah Berlin quoted Arkhilokhos 
as saying, rather than a fox who knew many tricks.11 He was the 
thinker who grasped most thoroughly and profoundly what the 
market system could do for human benefit. All societies in solv-
ing their economic problems face profound difficulties in getting 
reliable  information  to  the  deciders  and  then  incentivizing  the 
deciders to act for the public good. The market order of prop-
erty,  contract,  and  exchange  can—if  property  rights  are  han-
dled  properly— push  decision-making  out  to  the  decentralized

periphery  where  the  reliable  information  already  exists,  solving 
the information problem. And by rewarding those who bring re-
sources to valuable uses, it automatically solves the incentiviza-
tion  problem.  (There  remain  the  macro-coordination  problem 
and the distribution problem, and most of the flaws in Hayek’s 
thinking come from his inability to recognize the nature of those 
problems at all. But absolutely nailing two out of four ain’t bad.)
Overall, what Hayek got right is absolutely essential in mak-
ing sense of the long twentieth century’s economic history. His 
reasoning not only is cited by decision makers of varying influ-
ence throughout these decades, but aspects of what his reasoning 
elucidates were unquestionably at play.

We give the floor now to Karl Polanyi, who teacheth the les-
son that “the market is made for man, not man for the market.”12
Friedrich  von  Hayek  loved  that  the  market  turned  every-
thing into a commodity, and he feared those who damned the 
market  because  it  did  not  make  everybody  materially  equal. 
Polanyi  disagreed  emphatically.  In  The  Great  Transformation, 
Polanyi explained that land, labor, and finance were “fictitious 
commodities.” They could not be governed by the logic of prof-
it-and-loss but needed to be embedded in society and managed 
by the community, taking into account religious and moral di-
mensions. The result, Polanyi wrote, was a tension, a contest, 
a  double  movement.  Ideologues  of  the  market  and  the  market 
itself attempted to remove land, labor, and finance from society’s 
moral and religious governance. In reaction, society struck back 
by restricting the domain of the market and putting its thumb 
on the scales where market outcomes seemed “unfair.” As a con-
sequence, a market society will face a backlash—it can be a left-
wing backlash, it can be a right-wing backlash, but there will be 
a backlash—and it will be powerful.

Now  these  were—are—brilliant  insights.  As  expressed  by  
Polanyi in the original, they are also, sadly, incomprehensible to 
an overwhelming proportion of those who try to read him. With

Democratizing the Global North 

deference to comprehension, my summary of what Polanyi was 
really saying follows:

The market economy believes that the only rights that matter 
are property rights, and the only property rights that matter are 
those that produce things for which the rich have high demand. 
But people believe that they have other rights.

With respect to land, people believe they have rights to a sta-
ble community. This includes the belief that the natural and built 
environment in which they grew up or that they made with their 
hands is theirs, whether or not market logic says it would be more 
profitable if it were different—say a highway ran through it—or 
more lucrative if somebody else lived there.

With respect to labor, people believe they have a right to a 
suitable  income.  After  all,  they  prepared  for  their  profession, 
played by the rules, and so believe society owes them a fair in-
come, something commensurate with their preparation. And this 
holds whether or not the logic of the world market says otherwise.
With respect to finance, people believe that as long as they 
do their job of working diligently, the flow of purchasing power 
through the economy should be such as to give them the where-
withal to buy. And “rootless cosmopolite” financiers—powerful 
people with no connection to the community, and yes, this often 
shades,  and  more-than-shades,  over  into  antisemitism,  as  what 
is for Polanyi a critique of the operation of a system turns into a 
condemnation of Jewish and Jew-like people who fill a particular 
role in it—who may be thousands of miles away should have no 
commensurate right to decide that this or that flow of purchasing 
power through the economy is no longer sufficiently profitable, 
and so should be shut off. They should not be able to make your 
job dry up and blow away.13

People  have  not  just  property  rights,  Polanyi  declared,  but 
these other economic rights as well—rights that a pure market 
economy will not respect. A pure market economy will lay down 
that  highway,  ignore  years  of  preparation  when  doling  out  an 

95

income, and allow your purchasing power to dry up and blow 
away along with your job if someone thousands of miles away 
decides better returns on investments are to be found elsewhere. 
Hence  society—by  government  decree  or  by  mass  action,  left-
wing or right-wing, for good or ill—will intervene, and re-embed 
the economy in its moral and religious logic so that these rights 
are satisfied. The process is one of double movement: the econ-
omy  moves  to  remove  the  embedding  of  production,  transac-
tions, and consumption from the network of relationships that is 
society, and then society moves—somehow—to reassert itself.14

Note that these rights that society will attempt to validate do 
not—or might not—be rights to anything like an equal distri-
bution of the fruits of industry and agriculture. And it is proba-
bly wrong to describe them as fair: they are what people expect, 
given a certain social order. Equals should be treated equally, yes; 
but unequals should be treated unequally. And societies do not 
have  to  and  almost  never  do  presume  that  people  are  of  equal 
significance.

What can we do with these insights? Hayek and Polanyi were 
theoreticians and academicians—brilliant ones. But their insights 
and their doctrines are important only because they capture deep 
broad currents of thought that sparked through the brains of mil-
lions and drove actions. Not Hayek but Hayekians, not Polanyi 
but  Polanyians,  and  those  acting  on  the  motives  identified  by 
Polanyi, made history. So to get a glimpse of how this played 
out in practice, let us take a look at economics and politics in-
teracting at the bleeding edge—at the most rapidly growing and 
industrializing place on the pre–World War I earth, in that era’s 
counterpart to the twenty-first century’s Shenzhen: Chicago.15

In 1840, when the Illinois and Michigan Canal opened con-
necting the Mississippi River with the Great Lakes, Chicago had a 
population of four thousand. In 1871, Mrs. O’Leary’s cow burned 
down a third, perhaps, of the city. Chicago built the world’s first 
steel-framed skyscraper in 1885, the city had a population of two

million by 1900, and at that point 70 percent of its citizens had 
been born outside the United States.

On May 1, 1886, the American Federation of Labor declared 
a general strike to fight for an eight-hour workday. A frontline  
of  that  conflict  formed  at  the  gates  of  the  McCormick  Har-
vest Machine Company in Chicago. There, hundreds of police, 
backed up by private Pinkerton agency security guards, protected 
hundreds of strikebreakers who passed an angry crowd. On May 
3, police officers opened fire on the crowd, killing six. The next 
day in Haymarket Square eight police officers were murdered by 
an anarchist bomb during a rally in protest of police violence and 
in support of the striking workers. The police opened fire and 
killed perhaps twenty civilians (nobody seems to have counted), 
largely immigrants, largely non-English-speaking ones. A kanga-
roo  court  convicted  eight  innocent  (we  now  believe)  left-wing 
politicians  and  labor  organizers  of  murdering  the  eight  police-
men. Five were hanged.16

In 1889 Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federa-
tion of Labor, asked the world socialist movement—the “Second 
International”—to  set  aside  May  1  every  year  as  the  day  for  a 
great annual international demonstration in support of the eight-
hour workday and in memory of the victims of police violence in 
Chicago in 1886.

In the summer of 1894 President Grover Cleveland, in the 
fine  tradition  of  triangulating  politicians,  persuaded  Congress 
to establish a national holiday in recognition of the place of la-
bor in American society. But not on the International Workers’ 
Day,  May  1,  which  commemorated  Chicago’s  slain  workers—
rather, the new holiday would be observed on the first Monday 
in September.

Not all American politicians were so timid. In 1893 the new 
Democratic governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld—the state’s 
first Democratic governor since 1856, the first Chicago resident 
to  become  governor  ever,  and  the  first  foreign-born  governor

ever—pardoned the three still-living so-called Haymarket Bomb-
ers.  His  reasons  were  unambiguous.  Those  convicted  of  the 
bombing had likely been innocent. The real reason for the bomb-
ing, in Altgeld’s view, had been the out-of-control violence by the 
Pinkerton guards hired by McCormick and others.

Who was this Altgeld who pardons convicted anarchists and 
blames  violence  on  the  manufacturing  princes  of  the  Midwest 
and their hired armed goons? And how did he become governor 
of Illinois?

Altgeld  was  born  in  Germany.  His  parents  moved  him  to 
Ohio in 1848, when he was three months old. He fought in the 
Union Army during the Civil War, and at Fort Monroe, in the 
Virginia tidewater country, he caught a lifelong case of malaria. 
After the war he finished high school, became a roving railroad 
worker, found work as a schoolteacher, and somewhere in there 
read the law sufficiently to become a lawyer. By 1872 he was the 
city attorney of Savannah, Missouri. By 1874 he was county pros-
ecutor. In 1875 he showed up in Chicago as the author of Our 
Penal Machinery and Its Victims.17 By 1884 he was an unsuccess-
ful Democratic candidate for Congress—and a strong supporter 
of Democratic presidential candidate Grover Cleveland.

He won election as a judge on Cook County’s Superior Court 
in 1886. And somewhere in there he became rich. He was a real 
estate speculator and a builder: his biggest holding was the tallest 
building in Chicago in 1891, the sixteen-story Unity Building, at 
127 N. Dearborn Street.

An immigrant in a city of immigrants, he was also a Progres-
sive. As governor, Altgeld supported and persuaded the legisla-
ture  to  enact  what  became  the  most  stringent  child  labor  and 
workplace safety laws in the nation up to that point, increased 
state funding for education, and appointed women to senior state 
government positions. And he pardoned anarchists.

The  largely  Republican  and  Republican-funded  press  con-
demned Governor Altgeld for his Haymarket pardons. For the

rest of his life, to middle-class newspaper readers nationwide, es-
pecially on the East Coast, who were the middle tranche of those 
who managed to vote, Altgeld was the foreign-born alien anar-
chist, socialist, murderous governor of Illinois. Even when they 
brought themselves to consider reforms, they looked to the likes 
of President Cleveland to deliver them. To see the consequences, 
consider the Pullman Strike.

On May 11, 1894, workers of the Pullman Corporation, man-
ufacturer of sleeping cars and equipment, went on strike rather 
than accept wage cuts. Altgeld’s friend and fellow attorney Clar-
ence Darrow explained in his autobiography how he wound up 
as the lawyer of the strikers, the United Railroad Association, and 
their leader Eugene V. Debs. Darrow had been a railroad lawyer 
for the Chicago and Northwestern, with a wife and a ten-year-old. 
He quit his job to defend strike leader Debs.

About the nature of the contest he had no doubts:

Industrial  contests  take  on  the  attitudes  and  psychology  of 
war, and both parties do many things that they should never 
dream of doing in times of peace. . . . As I stood on the prai-
rie watching the burning [railroad] cars I had no feeling of 
enmity toward either side, I was only sad to realize how little 
pressure man could stand before he reverted to the primitive. 
This I have thought many times since that eventful night.18

Yet with no feelings of enmity, and even after watching striker 
violence and arson, Darrow sided with the strikers. What won 
Darrow  over  to  their  cause  was  watching  the  railroads’  blatant 
efforts to bring the force of the government in on their side. “I 
did not regard this as fair,” Darrow later wrote. So when Debs 
and others asked him to take on the case, he agreed to do so, later 
writing, “I saw poor men giving up their livelihood.”

The  railroads  were  successful  in  bringing  in  the  govern-

Democrat elected president between James Buchanan and Wood-
row Wilson— decided to grant their request. He attached a mail 
car to every train, making blocking any train an interference with 
the US mail, and thus a federal crime. The US attorney general, 
Richard Olney, got the courts to enjoin the strikers, forbidding 
the obstruction of trains. Cleveland then ordered the US Army to 
deploy in Chicago.

Governor  Altgeld  protested.  In  two  telegraphs  to  the  pres-
ident,  he  pointed  out  that  the  Constitution  gave  the  president 
power to use troops against domestic violence only “on applica-
tion of the [state] legislature, or the executive (when the legisla-
ture  cannot  be  convened).”19  Altgeld  protested  that  neither  he 
nor the Illinois legislature had applied. Cleveland’s response was 
dismissive. It was more important to protect property against ri-
oters, anarchists, and socialists, he declared: “If it takes the entire 
army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chi-
cago, that card will be delivered!”20

On July 7, Debs and the other union leaders were arrested 
for violating the terms of the injunction, and the strike collapsed.
This was a breaking point for Altgeld and for many others, 
who subsequently decided that it was time for the Democratic 
Party’s presidential nominee to be a truly Democratic candidate, 
not a centrist like Cleveland. Altgeld and his supporters wanted 
their rights as Polanyi would later express them: they wanted the 
fairness and justice that Hayek would decry. They also wanted 
the United States to abandon the gold standard and permit the 
free coinage of silver, at a ratio of sixteen ounces of silver to one 
ounce of gold.

Cleveland  and  his  supporters,  many  of  them  businessmen 
and bankers, favored adherence to a strict gold standard in or-
der to maintain the value of the dollar. Altgeld and his support-
ers, many of them laborers or farmers, wanted an expansionary 
money policy— unlimited coinage of silver—because they felt it 
would ease their credit burdens and raise prices for their crops.

What the “Free Silver” proponents wanted was, in short, the op-
posite of what Cleveland and his supporters wanted. Both views 
were reactions in part to the Panic of 1893.

At  the  1896  Democratic  National  Convention,  Altgeld 
seized  control  of  the  platform  and  changed  it  to  condemn  the 
gold standard, denounce the government’s interventions against 
labor  unions,  support  federalism,  and  call  for  an  income  tax 
amendment or a Supreme Court that would declare an income 
tax constitutional to allow the government to gradually redistrib-
ute wealth and to raise the resources to carry out the Progressive 
platform. The platform also supported the right to unionize and 
called for expanded personal and civil liberties.

To advance the cause, Altgeld sought to get the Democratic 
Party  to  nominate  former  US  senator  Richard  P.  Bland.  The 
young William Jennings Bryan, politician from Nebraska, how-
ever, had other ideas. In a speech that damned the gold standard 
and a parade of moneyed interests, Bryan wowed the convention. 
He headed a presidential ticket, with the unprepossessing Arthur 
Sewall as his running mate.

In  response,  President  Cleveland  and  his  supporters  aban-
doned  the  Democratic  Party  and  formed  the  National  Demo-
cratic Party, which ran the ex-Republican Illinois governor and 
ex-Union general John M. Palmer alongside ex-Kentucky gover-
nor and ex-Confederate general Simon Bolivar Buckner, in hopes 
of syphoning votes from Bryan and Sewall.

The  Republican  ticket  of  William  McKinley  and  Garret  

Hobart won.

Popular vote totals in presidential elections in the decades be-
fore 1896 had been narrow. The political mythology might have 
led people to think that, by nominating a populist like Bryan, 
the Democrats could enjoy an overwhelming victory in 1896. 
But it was not to be so. Bryan lost, and lost by much more than 
Democrats had lost in the presidential elections of recent previ-
ous decades. William McKinley won in an electoral landslide,

with  a  final  electoral  count  of  271–176,  and  a  popular-vote 
semi- landslide. It was not so much that crucial swing voters in 
the US electorate swung to the Republican side. It was, rather, 
a huge countermobilization against William Jennings Bryan and 
a turnout increase that determined the outcome of the election. 
There were many voters, it turned out, who were formerly on 
the fence and insufficiently interested to take the trouble to show 
up at the polls who did show up in 1896, and they definitely 
did not want the sort of Democratic candidate that Altgeld and 
his allies favored. (Not, mind you, that the Democratic Party in 
1896 could be properly characterized as egalitarian: of Bryan’s 
176 electoral votes, 129 came from states that, had Blacks been 
allowed to vote, would have swung to the Republican side, be-
cause Lincoln had freed the slaves.)

When the crucial center of the white males who had the vote 
and exercised it was asked to choose between protecting property, 
on  the  one  hand,  and  promoting  opportunity  through  means 
convincingly  portrayed  as  threatening  property  and  order,  on 
the other, they chose property—because they had it, or thought 
they would have it—and because they feared that too many of 
those who would benefit from redistribution were in some sense 
unworthy of it. Even the very weak-tea leveling associated with 
pardoning those railroaded after Haymarket and supporting the 
Pullman  strikers  was  too  much  for  start  of  twentieth-century 
America to bear.

Altgeld lost his governorship, lost a bid to be mayor of Chi-
cago in 1899, and died, at the age of fifty-four, in 1902. Clar-
ence Darrow lived longer and more successfully, in part because 
he was willing to defend large corporations, among other groups 
and ideas, in the remainder of his legal career—including evo-
lution and high school teachers, murderers, and trade union of-
ficials. Whatever affinities he had for the notions of Polanyi, he 
was mindful of the influence of Hayek’s ideas on the society in 
which he lived. “Conflicted” is the word, as he noted in a letter to

his friend Jane Addams in the mid-1890s: “I came [to Chicago] 
without friends or money. Society provides no fund out of which 
such people can live while preaching heresy. It compels us to get 
our living out of society as it is or die. I do not choose yet to die, 
although  perhaps  it  would  be  the  best.”21  Among  those  young 
idealistic  workers  who  passed  through  Jane  Addams’s  private 
social-welfare agency, the Chicago Hull House, was the young 
Frances Perkins, who was to become President Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt’s secretary of labor and the principal author of Ameri-
ca’s social security system.

For all of his personal concessions, Darrow shared Altgeld’s 
opinion  of  the  Democratic  politicians.  They  were  not  proper 
standard-bearers for the causes that he thought would bring the 
United States closer to utopia, as his 1932 memoirs explained: “I 
had  always  admired  Woodrow  Wilson  and  distrusted  [his  suc-
cessor] Republican President [Warren] Harding. Doubtless my 
opinions  about  both  in  relation  to  affairs  of  government  were 
measurably correct; still, Mr. Wilson, a scholar and an idealist, 
and Mr. Palmer, a Quaker, kept [Eugene V.] Debs in prison; and 
Mr. Harding and Mr. Dougherty unlocked the door.”22

Darrow spent the 1920s defending the teaching of evolution  
(in the Scopes Monkey Trial) and attacking social Darwinist eu-
genicists.  (Of  one  such,  he  said,  “By  what  psychological  hocus- 
pocus he reaches the conclusion that the ability to read intelligently 
denotes a good germ-plasm and [produces] desirable citizens I can-
not say.”23) Darrow died in 1938 at the age of eighty-one. In the 
mid-1920s Scopes Trial, he had faced off against his old political 
ally, William Jennings Bryan. Bryan had added anti- evolutionism 
and tolerance of the Ku Klux Klan to his 1920s causes of an equal 
rights  amendment  for  women,  agricultural  subsidies,  a  federal 
minimum wage, public financing of political campaigns, and Flor-
ida real estate.

The Democratic Party of 1900 or so was against plutocrats, 
bankers, and monopolists. It was for a rough equality. But it was

a strange kind of rough equality among the right sort of people. 
Socialist-pacifists—such as Eugene V. Debs, who besides being 
involved with the Pullman strikers opposed US entry into World 
War I—did not belong. And neither did Blacks. Woodrow Wil-
son  was  a  Progressive,  and  well  respected  on  the  left.  He  also 
segregated the US federal government’s civil service.

W.  E.  B.  Du  Bois  was  born  in  1868  in  Great  Barrington, 
Massachusetts. He was raised by his mother, Mary, and her par-
ents, Othello and Sarah Lampman Burghardt. Othello’s grand-
father, Tom, had been the first Black person to move to Great 
Barrington,  where  he  died  in  around  1787  at  the  age  of  fifty. 
W. E. B. Du Bois’s white neighbors took up a collection to pay 
for him to go to Fisk University, a historically Black university 
in  Nashville.  He  then  went  from  Fisk  to  Harvard  (earning  a 
bachelor’s degree in history and graduating cum laude in 1890). 
He went from Harvard to the University of Berlin, where, as he 
later said, his peers did not see him “as a curiosity, or something 
sub-human,” but as “a man of the somewhat privileged student 
rank, with whom they were glad to meet and talk over the world; 
particularly,  the  part  of  the  world  whence  I  came.”  He  found 
himself “on the outside of the American world, looking in.” He 
then  returned  to  Harvard,  where  he  earned  a  PhD—the  first 
Black man to do so—in 1895 at the age of twenty-seven.24

In 1895 there was a Cotton States and International Expo-
sition held in Atlanta, Georgia, to show the world that the ex- 
Confederate states of the US South were back—with technology, 
with agriculture, ready to produce and trade with the world. But 
at the same time, there were all the lynchings of Blacks—at least 
113 of them in 1895. President Ulysses S. Grant had attempted to 
make it the US Army’s mission to protect Black people from the 
white supremacists’ guerrilla-terror campaign, and at his urging, 
Congress had passed bills attempting to stop the violence. These 
attempts, however, ended when Grant left the White House. His

successor, Rutherford B. Hayes, traded that cause away—along 
with the power of one million Black men in the South to vote—
in return for electoral votes.

At  the  exposition,  the  Black  leader  Booker  T.  Washington 
gave  a  speech  proposing  what  became  known  as  his  “Atlanta 
compromise”: Blacks, he said, should not seek the vote—or in-
tegration,  or,  indeed,  equal  treatment;  instead,  they,  and  white 
northerners seeking their uplift, should focus their attention on 
education and employment. “The opportunity to earn a dollar in 
a factory just now is worth infinitely more than the opportunity  
to spend a dollar in an opera house,” he said. Blacks should get 
a  “basic”  education.  In  return  for  this  submission,  they  should 
receive  the  protection  of  the  rule  of  law  and  the  guerrilla- 
terror  campaign  should  end.  “Cast  down  your  bucket  where 
you are,” was Washington’s watch-phrase. That was the best he 
thought Blacks could do at the time. They should concentrate on  
education—seeking  an  overwhelmingly  vocational  education—
and then work, save, and let the wheel of history turn.25

Du  Bois  disagreed  with  Booker  T.  Washington  and  took 
the leadership of those arguing and agitating for full equality— 
social,  political,  economic—now.  Yes,  there  had  been  progress 
since the days of slavery.26 No, the progress was not sufficient. 
Meanwhile, he noted, the white supremacist campaign of terror 
was not ending.

Four years after Washington’s speech, in the same city, a Black 
man, Sam Hose, was accused of killing his white employer, Alfred 
Cranford, a farmer, who had gotten out his gun and threatened to 
shoot Hose when Hose had asked for time off to visit his mother. 
White supremacist agitators, lying, claimed that Hose had also 
tried to rape Alfred’s wife, Mattie Cranford. A mob of at least five 
hundred took Hose away from the sheriff; cut off his testicles, pe-
nis, fingers, and ears; chained him to a pine tree; and then lit the 
pine tree on fire. The members of the mob did not wear masks or

refuse to give their names. It took Hose more than thirty minutes 
to die. Members of the mob then cut off more of his body parts, 
including bones, and sold them as souvenirs.

Du Bois later said that when he saw Hose’s burned knuckles 
in a storefront display, he knew he had to break with Booker T. 
Washington. Blacks needed to make demands for equal rights, 
equal treatment, integration, and parity. The community needed 
to  support  the  “Talented  Tenth,”  who  would  show  the  world 
what educated and entrepreneurial Blacks could and would do, 
and the Talented Tenth needed to repay the community by go-
ing into politics. Otherwise, white supremacy would grind Black 
people down and then justify itself by pointing to the small num-
bers of accomplished Blacks: “For three long centuries this peo-
ple lynched Negroes who dared to be brave, raped black women 
who dared to be virtuous, crushed dark-hued youth who dared 
to be ambitious, and encouraged and made to flourish servility 
and lewdness and apathy,” he wrote. And yet “a saving remnant 
continually survives and persists,” demonstrating “the capability 
of Negro blood, the promise of black men.”

He believed in the promise of education to solve the problem, 
but not just technical and trade education, like Washington. For 
Du Bois, the answer lay in a full liberal arts college education for 
the potential meritocratic elite he called the “Talented Tenth”: 
“Education  must  not  simply  teach  work—it  must  teach  Life. 
The Talented Tenth of the Negro race must be made leaders of 
thought and missionaries of culture among their people. No oth-
ers can do this and Negro colleges must train men for it.”27

But Du Bois and company were rowing against a very strong 
current. From 1875 to 1925 or so, rising segregation and discrim-
ination continued to stomp down the “Talented Tenth” wher-
ever they appeared. Politicians and interest groups, fearing white 
populism, sensed the possibility of anger directed at rich urban 
eastern  plutocrats  and  worked  hard  to  redirect  it  into  anger  at

lazy Negroes. Those who stuck to the goal of a relatively egalitar-
ian income distribution in the face of social Darwinism redefined 
the “fitness” that was to survive and flourish as an ethno-racial 
attribute. Thus a Woodrow Wilson sought to raise up the white 
middle class and degrade the Black population, and Wilson’s Pro-
gressive coalition did not say “boo.”

WHATEVER  ELSE  CONSTITUTED  AMERICAN  exceptionalism, 
marked caution toward “utopian” overhauls of social relations and 
social hierarchies—whether race or class based—was very high on 
that list. And the United States was not alone. Once European 
society was no longer a contest of a closed aristocracy of wealth, 
honor, and blood against everybody else, once upward mobility 
was  possible,  anything  that  was  or  could  be  misrepresented  as 
full-fledged leveling socialism proved broadly unattractive.

We can see this at work well before our starting date of 1870. 
Consider France in June 1848. That year a wave of political dis-
content washed across Europe, encouraging many to embrace lib-
eral reforms. But those who thought a truly just, equitable utopia 
beckoned were to be disappointed. What Alexis de Tocqueville 
discovered, along with all of Europe, was that the overwhelming 
majority of Frenchmen did not want to be taxed to provide full 
employment for urban craftsmen. It turned out they valued their 
property more than they valued opportunity for the unemployed.
In 1848 the farmers of Tocqueville’s France sided against the 
socialists when, as Tocqueville put it, the socialists—that is, the 
workers—rose in “a blind and rude, but powerful, effort . . . to 
escape from the necessities of their condition, which had been de-
picted to them as one of unlawful oppression.”28 He was referring 
to the June Days uprising, a reaction against the government’s 
decision  to  close  the  Second  Republic’s  National  Workshops, 
which had provided work for the unemployed. The workshops

had been funded by taxing farmers, who did not want to pay for 
a burgeoning program for urban workers. In the heated conflict, 
an estimated 4,500 died, and thousands more were injured.

The politicians of the French Second Republic were terrified 
and abandoned the worker movement. The lesson of French pol-
itics since 1789 had been that, unless there was a Napoleon (or 
someone similar) on hand to send in a disciplined military—with 
orders  to  shoot  down  the  mob  and  blow  up  the  barricades—
mobs  in  Paris  unmade  governments.  But  the  Paris  June  Days 
were different. Tocqueville, who opposed the worker movement, 
later wrote that he saw “thousands . . . hastening to our aid from 
every part of France.” He noted that peasants, shopkeepers, land-
lords,  and  nobles  “rushed  into  Paris  with  unequalled  ardour,” 
partly via rail travel, making for a “strange and unprecedented” 
spectacle: “The insurgents received no reinforcements, whereas 
we had all France for reserves.”

The same principle was at work in the United States in 1896 

and in France in 1848.

Yet back in the days of the French Revolution of 1789, order 
had much less appeal to those not at the top of the social pyramid: 
“Let’s strangle the last king with the guts of the last priest!” said 
philosopher and critic Denis Diderot.29 Diderot died before the 
revolution—which might well have been a blessing for Diderot: 
the revolutionaries came within a hair of executing American de-
mocracy activist Thomas Paine, who had traveled to France to 
help them, just because. Yes, the French did manage to murder 
King Louis XVI. Yes, they did wind up with an egalitarian distri-
bution of land parceled out to families of small farmers. But they 
did not wind up with a stable political democracy.

In succession after 1791, France experienced the terrorist dic-
tatorship  of  the  Jacobins;  the  corrupt  and  gerrymandered  five-
man  Directory;  a  dictatorship  under  Napoleon  Bonaparte  as 
“first consul”; a monarchy until 1848; a First Republic; a Second 
Republic; a shadow of an empire under Napoleon Bonaparte’s

nephew Louis Napoleon; a socialist commune (in Paris at least); 
a Third Republic, which suppressed the commune and elevated a 
royalist to president; and, peaking in 1889, the efforts of an aspi-
rant dictator and ex-minister of war, Georges Ernest Jean-Marie 
Boulanger, with his promise of Revanche, Révision, Restauration 
(revenge  on  Germany,  revision  of  the  constitution,  and  resto-
ration of the monarchy).30

And yet land reform stuck. Dreams of past and hopes of fu-
ture military glory stuck. And for those on the left of politics, the 
dream  of  a  transformational,  piratical  political  revolution—the 
urban  people  marching  in  arms  (or  not  in  arms)  to  overthrow 
corruption  and  establish  justice,  liberty,  and  utopia—stuck  as 
well.  Regime  stability  did  not,  and  “normal  politics”  between 
1870 and 1914 always proceeded under revolutionary threat, or 
were colored by revolutionary dreams.

This was true elsewhere in Europe as well. The continent’s 
nationalities grew to want unity, independence, autonomy, and 
safety—which  first  and  foremost,  especially  in  the  case  of  the 
German states, meant safety from invasion by France. Achiev-
ing any portion of these outcomes generally entailed, rather than 
wholesale  redistribution,  a  curbing  of  privileges,  and  then  an 
attempt  to  grab  onto  and  ride  the  waves  of  globalization  and 
technological advance. Those waves, however, wrenched society 
out of its established orders. As class and ethnic cleavages rein-
forced themselves, the avoidance of civil war and ethnic cleans-
ing became more difficult, especially when your aristocrats spoke 
a  foreign  language  and  your  rabble-rousers  declared  that  they 
were  the  ones  who  could  satisfy  peasant  and  worker  demands 
for “peace, land, and bread.” Increasingly, in those parts of the 
world without colonial masters, politics became a game without 
rules—except those the players made up on whim and opportu-
nity. Nearly everywhere and at nearly any moment, the structure 
of a regime, and the modes of political action, might suddenly 
shift, perhaps in a very bad way. Representative institutions were

shaky, and partial. Promises by rulers of new constitutions that 
would resolve legitimate grievances were usually empty promises.
In the end, the regimes held until World War I. The games 
went on. Outside the Balkans, the only regime change in Europe 
between 1871 and 1913 was the low-casualty proclamation of the 
Portuguese Republic in November 1910.

The expectation and fear that revolutions were on the agenda 
proved to be wrong. One reason was that always, in the moment, 
left-wing—even  socialist—parties  in  pre–World  War  I  Europe 
wanted  parliamentary  representation,  but  once  they  had  that, 
they pressed immediately for only relatively weak tea. Consider 
the Socialist Party of Germany, which sought to rally the radical 
edge of the nation’s voters with the following:31

universal male and female suffrage
the secret ballot, proportional representation, and an end 

to gerrymandering
holidays for elections
two-year legislative terms
the right to propose and vote on referendums
elected local administrators and judges
a referendum requirement for declarations of war
international courts to settle international disputes
equal rights for women
freedom of speech, association, and religion
a prohibition against spending public funds for religious 

purposes

free public schools and colleges
free legal assistance
abolition of the death penalty
free medical care, including midwifery
progressive income and property taxes

a progressive inheritance tax
an end to regressive indirect taxes
an eight-hour working day
child labor laws
a national takeover of unemployment and disability 

insurance “with decisive participation by the workers”

Rather white bread, no?
But they also sought in the long run not incremental advance, 
but the complete reordering of society and economy into a real 
utopia. The Socialist Party of Germany’s platforms also called for:

By every lawful means to bring about a free state and a social-
istic society, to effect the destruction of the iron law of wages 
by doing away with the system of wage labor . . .

The transformation of the capitalist private ownership of 
the means of production—land and soil, pits and mines, raw 
materials,  tools,  machines,  means  of  transportation—into 
social  property  and  the  transformation  of  the  production   
of  goods  into  socialist  production  carried  on  by  and  for   
society . . .

Emancipation . . . of  the  entire  human  race. . . . But  it 
can only be the work of the working class, because all other 
classes . . . have as their common goal the preservation of the 
foundations of contemporary society.

The demands seem contradictory. Were the German social-
ists revolutionary overthrowers of a rotten system, or improvers 
of a going concern? They could not decide, and so found them-
selves falling between the two stools.

We  now  come  to  one  of  the  inflection  points  in  this  long 
century’s history. The tensions were already there between two 
camps,  broadly  speaking:  those  who  fell  under  the  banner  of

Hayek’s  “blessed  be  the  name  of  the  market,”  and  those  who 
fell under the banner of Polanyi’s “the market is made for man.” 
Broadly. Things get messy. What was held in common by all was 
a faith, of varying sorts, in the market. And some of these faiths 
were more utopian than others.

Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and those who drew inspiration 
from them had no illusions about what the market taketh, but 
they had a grand illusion as to what the market would eventually 
giveth, or transcend itself to become—the revolution of the pro-
letariat.  Earl  Grey,  Benjamin  Disraeli,  and  other  right-wingers 
understood that the market is made for some men, but not all—
and, likewise, that some men, but not all, would benefit. Finally, 
centrists attempted to hold the tensions at bay with many reforms 
and a few bayonets. It mostly worked—until 1914.

While the center was holding, and the left was falling be-
tween two stools, the right was thinking up new justifications 
for its basic principle: “What I have, I hold!” English natural-
ist Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species had set intellectual waves 
in motion: ideas that turned into social Darwinism. The social 
Darwinists justified economic inequality not by looking to the 
past, to the descent of the rich from the henchmen of William 
the Conqueror, but by looking to the present and the future, by 
claiming that inherent racial traits both accounted for their eco-
nomic success and justified existing economic inequalities. One 
step  further,  and  they  were  proposing  that  the  superior  races 
should be encouraged to breed, and others should not. As John 
Maynard Keynes was to remark a generation later, in the eyes  
of  the  social  Darwinists,  “socialist  interferences  became . . .  
impious,  as  calculated  to  retard  the  onward  movement  of  the 
mighty process by which we ourselves had risen like Aphrodite 
out of the primeval slime of ocean.”32

Ideologies are not like streetcars, in that you can pull the cord 
and get off at the next stop whenever you wish. But they are like 
streetcars in a different respect: they have tracks that they must

follow. Social Darwinists justified economic inequality within so-
cieties as part of a progressive struggle for existence that, via evo-
lution, improved the gene pool.33 Why not, then, take the next 
step, and see relationships between nations as a similar struggle 
for existence that, again via evolution, improved the gene pool? 
“I am better than you” became, all too easily, “We are better than 
they.” And “we” had to have the weapons to prove it, should it 
come to a fight.

Jennie Jerome’s son, Winston S. Churchill, was in the cabi-
net of the British Liberal government in the 1900s. Alarm at the 
growing size of the German battle fleet was mounting, and Brit-
ain needed control of the seas to tie its empire together. More-
over, Britain imported half its food. A German battle fleet that 
controlled the seas around Britain could starve half of Britain to 
death. As Churchill told the story, the Liberal Party government, 
to appease the navy and the press, offered to fund four new dread-
nought-class  battleships  a  year  to  defend  against  the  growing  
German fleet. The navy demanded six. And, Churchill said, “We 
compromised at eight.”34

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had his detective character Sherlock 
Holmes comment on rising international tensions as World War I 
approached: “There’s an east wind coming all the same,” Holmes 
says.  “It  will  be  cold  and  bitter,  Watson,  and  a  good  many  of 
us may wither before its blast. But . . . a cleaner, better, stronger 
land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared.”35

Doyle wrote those words in 1917, when World War I was 
more  than  half  done.  But  he  placed  them  in  the  mouth  of  a  
pre-1914 Holmes. He had Holmes prophesy that, in spite of all 
the blood, global war should not be avoided, for it would, in the 
end, turn out to have been worthwhile. The political, social, cul-
tural, and economic barometer was dropping. The warning signs 
were abundant: a right-wing upper class had, by and large, lost 
its social role; politicians were increasingly anxious to paper over 
class divisions with appeals to national unity; a social Darwinist

ideological current advocating struggle—even or especially mili-
tary struggle by peoples-in-arms—over not what language a prov-
ince would be administered in, but whose grandchildren would 
live there, was growing. These issues were storing up trouble as 
1914 approached. The unleashing of unprecedented economic 
growth had shaken the world and transformed politics. And at 
the end of that transformation was a pronounced imperial and 
militaristic turn.

In 1919, John Maynard Keynes would write, bitterly, that he, 
his peers, and his elders among the well-thinking, self- confident 
establishment had all shrugged off the warning signs and passively 
sat  by.  They  had  regarded  “the  projects  and  politics  of  milita-
rism and imperialism, of racial and cultural rivalries, of monop-
olies, restrictions, and exclusion, which were to play the serpent 
to this [pre-1914 economic growth] paradise . . . [as] little more 
than the amusements of [the] daily newspaper.” To him and his 
ilk, Keynes would say, looking back through the rearview mir-
ror, the idea that the progressive system of increasing prosperity 
might break down was “aberrant [and] scandalous”—and easily 
avoidable.36

As 1914 approached, there was no intellectual or organizational 
antimilitarist  countermobilization  to  speak  of  to  try  to  head  off 
catastrophe.

Global Empires

I n 1870, at the start of the long twentieth century, one of the 

greatest empires the world has ever seen—the British Empire, 
the only potential peer of which was the Mongol Empire—was 
approaching its zenith. Part of what made it the greatest is that 
this  empire  had  both  formal  and  informal  manifestations—it 
came in the form of standing armies, colonial offices staffed by 
bureaucrats, and jails to enforce deference, but exercised its will in 
all sorts of other, less tangible ways as well. Because we all know 
how this particular story ends, I feel no guilt in flashing forward. 
The year 1945 saw the completion of the supersession of Brit-
ain by the United States as the world’s leading industrial, com-
mercial, and imperial power. What’s interesting is that once the 
United States established itself as the world’s preeminent power, 
it set about building an American empire that was, unlike its pre-
decessor’s, almost entirely informal.

Right here I have a narrative problem. The big-picture story 
of the “global north,” or the North Atlantic region, from 1870 to 
1914 can be pounded (with some violence) into the framework of 
one narrative thread. What would become known as the “global 
south”—that is, countries generally south of, but more impor-
tantly, on the economic periphery of, the global north—cannot. 
And my space and your attention are limited. What is more, a

century most defined by its economic history is a century cen-
tered on the global north. This, of course, says nothing about cul-
tures or civilizations, or even the relative merits of global north or 
south in general, or nations in particular. It is merely to assert that 
the economic activity and advances of the one region of the world 
causally led the economic activity and advances of the other.

Given this background, what I offer you here are four import-
ant  vignettes:  India,  Egypt,  China,  and  Japan.  To  situate  our-
selves in these national histories, understand that while 1870 is 
the water shed year of the global north’s economic growth spurt, 
it is (not coincidentally) the middle of the story of imperialism for 
the global south. Perhaps not the exact middle, for the imperial-
ism project starts in 1500 and, as a project, ends in the later 1900s. 
As I said, the interpretive ground here gets slippery. And for pur-
chase we can recall our two-person chorus, Friedrich August von 
Hayek and Karl Polanyi, watching, waiting, and whispering.

Europe—or,  rather,  Spain  and  Portugal—started  building 
empires in the 1500s. It was not that they had unique technolog-
ical or organizational powers compared to the rest of the world. 
Rather, they had interlocking systems—religious, political, admin-
istrative,  and  commercial—that  together  reinforced  the  reasons 
to seek power in the form of imperial conquest. Empire building 
made political-military, ideological-religious, and economic sense. 
Spain’s  conquistadores  set  out  to  serve  the  king,  to  spread  the  
word of God, and to get rich.1 Other adventurers and wannabe 
imperialists from elsewhere on the globe did not have such a strong 
set of interlocking incentives and capabilities.

When the Portuguese arrived in what is now Malaysia in the 
1500s, they met political-military opposition from local rulers, 
ideological-religious opposition from Islamic communities, and 
economic opposition from Chinese traders who did not want to 
be  displaced.  But  Chinese  merchants  had  no  political  backing 
from  their  Ming  rulers.  Local  sultans  could  not  summon  reli-
gious-ideological  energy  for  crusades  to  expel  the  Portuguese.

And these local Islamic communities were not profitable enough 
for faraway sultans and allies to generate sustained intervention. 
The Portuguese—and the Spanish, and later the Dutch, French, 
and  British—had  it  all,  gold,  guns,  God,  and  kings,  working 
together.2

So the European overseas empires took root and grew in the 
1500s  and  thereafter.  The  period  from  1500  to  1770  was  an 
Imperial- Commercial  Age,  with  imperialism  and  globalization  
advancing along all their dimensions: military, political, economic, 
and cultural, for great good and great ill.

These early empires were, however, limited. Outside of the 
Americas, the sea became European, but the land did not. Sea 
control, however, meant a great deal. In the 1500s and 1600s, 
control  over  the  high-value,  low-weight  luxury  goods  of  East 
Asia, or over the precious metals of Latin America, made individ-
uals’ fortunes, provided healthy boosts to early modern European 
royal treasuries, and channeled the energies of potentially disrup-
tive  young  men  and  enthusiastic  missionaries  bent  on  pleasing 
their God.

This  dynamic  also  produced  the  tobacco,  sugar,  and  slave 
trades,  and  made  West  Indian  empires  both  the  focus  of  high 
politics and a driver of what was then slow economic growth. The 
slave  trade,  meanwhile,  devastated  Africa  and  plausibly  created 
the conditions that today keep it the planet’s poorest continent.3
But by 1870 the logic of empire appeared to be ebbing. There 
was  little  in  the  way  of  luxuries  that  could  not  be  made  more 
cheaply in the industrial core. Plus, it became more expensive to 
conquer than to trade. But empires are not built on logic alone, 
and even after 1870 they continued to grow. Conquering, con-
trolling, exploiting, and with these a general debasing, continued.
Imperialism was perhaps lamentable, but inevitable, one-half 
of our chorus whispers. There was so much money to be made 
by bringing the world into a single marketplace, and to function, 
marketplaces  have  to  be  governed  by  something.  The  market

giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be the name of the mar-
ket. It was largely intentional, and explicable, if still lamentable, 
the other half of our chorus whispers. The market was made for 
man, not man for the market.

By 1870 the difference in power between imperial metropole 
and subjected colony had become immense—in technological, 
organizational, and political terms. The improvements in trans-
port  and  communications  made  war  and  conquest  and  occu-
pation  vastly  easier.  There  was  no  part  of  the  world  in  which 
Western  Europeans  could  not—if  they  wished—impose  their 
will by armed force at moderate cost. And proconsuls were rarely 
focused  on  just  what  resources  would  flow  back  to  the  impe-
rial metropolis from their particular outpost of empire. After all, 
the outposts were populated, and often led, by disruptive young 
men with things to prove, or enthusiastic missionaries with souls 
to  save.  Whether  it  might  not  be  cheaper  in  the  long  run  to 
simply trade and pay for those resources was for many a tertiary 
concern.

These enterprising young men and zealous missionaries not 

only had means, but also method.

Consider the 1898 Battle of Omdurman in the Sudan, during 
which  ten  thousand  soldiers  of  the  Mahdist  Sudanese  regime 
died.  Only  forty-eight  British  and  Egyptian  soldiers  died.  The 
difference  was  not  entirely  due  to  superior  European  military 
technology. The Mahdist regime had proto-machine-guns, tele-
graphs, and mines—all bought from European suppliers. What 
it did not have was the organizational capacity and discipline to 
make effective use of them.4

The  consequence  of  a  disciplined  global  north  more  orga-
nizationally  capable  was  a  globe  integrated  into  the  European- 
dominated  world  economy,  much  of  it  ruled  or  swayed  by 
European proconsuls, and the spread of European languages and 
European preferences: European-style schools, European culture, 
and European methods of administration, science, and technology.

Harbors, railroads, factories, and plantations sprung up, from Bali, 
in what is now Indonesia, to Accra, in what is now Ghana.

And everywhere peoples were told that they were dirt under 

the feet of their European rulers.

Consider  India.  In  early  1756,  the  newly  installed  Nawab 
of Bengal, Mirza Mohammad Siraj ud-Dowla, wished to show 
the British in Calcutta who was master of Bengal. He borrowed 
some gunners and artillery pieces from the French and attacked 
and captured Calcutta and its Fort William. He expected nego-
tiations, and that the subsequent peace would produce a grateful 
France, much higher taxes paid to him by trading Europeans, and 
much less tax evasion via smuggling by the chastened British.

Big mistake.
The British sent 3,000 soldiers—800 British, 2,200 Indian— 
north  by  sea  from  Madras  to  Calcutta.  Siraj  ud-Dowla  mobi-
lized for the battle. British commander Robert Clive bribed the 
Nawab’s  three  subordinates.  And  in  the  aftermath  the  British 
East India Company acquired the taste for conquering, ruling, 
and taxing India rather than merely trading with it.

By  1772  Calcutta  was  the  capital  of  British  India.  Warren 
Hastings  was  its  first  governor-general.  The  British  East  India 
Company  had  entered  the  sweepstakes  in  the  succession  wars 
over the territories of the Mogul Empire. Each generation saw 
formerly  independent  principalities  become  subservient  allies. 
Each  generation  saw  former  allies  become  puppets.  And  each 
generation saw former puppets become territories ruled by Lon-
don. Nearly a century after Clive and Siraj ud-Dowla came the 
great Sepoy Mutiny (also known as the Indian Mutiny, the Sipahi 
Rebellion, or the Great Rebellion of 1857). It was defeated. And 
on May 1, 1876, the British government proclaimed Queen Vic-
toria I Hanover to be Kaiser-i-Hind: Empress of India.5

Back  in  1853  Karl  Marx  had  halted  work  on  his  magnum 
opus to try to get enough money together to keep from having 
to pawn his wife’s silver (again). He had written an essay titled

“The Future Results of British Rule in India” in which he proph-
esied that the British imperial conquest was India’s greatest short-
run curse and greatest long-run blessing: “England has to fulfill 
a double mission in India: one destructive, the other . . . laying 
the material foundations of Western society in Asia. . . . The po-
litical unity of India . . . imposed by the British sword, will now 
be strengthened and perpetuated by the electric telegraph. The 
native army, organized and trained by the British drill-sergeant, 
[will be] the sine qua non of Indian self-emancipation.”6

If you listen carefully, you’ll hear an echo of half our chorus, 
albeit with very different intonations. Blessed be the market. Yes, 
Marx would have it that the bourgeoisie effects progress by “drag-
ging individuals and people through blood and dirt, through mis-
ery and degradation.” But while it takes, on the one hand, it gives 
most lavishly—full emancipation, human emancipation, by set-
ting the stage for and providing the overwhelming incentives to 
pull the trigger to create Full Communism—with the other.

Yet as of 1914, the great economic and social changes that 
Karl Marx had confidently predicted sixty years before had not 
advanced very far. The drawing of a net of railways over India? 
Check. The introduction to India of those industries necessary 
to  support  the  railroads?  Check.  The  spread  of  other  branches 
of modern industry across India? Not so much. The spread of 
modern education across India? Not so much. Improvements in 
agricultural productivity, resulting from the creation of effective 
private property in land? Not at all. Overthrow of the caste sys-
tem? Not at all. The overthrow of British colonialism, the res-
toration of self-government, and the creation of subcontinental 
political unity by virtue of a revolt by the British-trained army? 
They had come remarkably close in 1857, but only close.

The  failure  of  the  British  Raj  to  transform  India  poses  an 
enormous problem for all of us economists. We are all, even the 
Marxist economists, the intellectual children of the Adam Smith 
who was reported by Dugald Stewart to have said, “Little else is

requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from 
the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable admin-
istration of justice: all the rest being brought about by the natural 
course of things.”7 Under the British Raj in the late nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries India had a remarkable degree of 
internal and external peace, a tolerable administration of justice, 
and easy taxes. Yet no sign of progress “to the highest degree of 
opulence” had occurred.8

Whether deemed natural or unnatural, the course of things 

had yielded different results.

Egypt provides another insightful example. Muhammed Ali 
(1769–1849),  an  Albanian  orphan,  son  of  shipping  merchant 
Ibrahim Agha and his wife, Zeynep, was bored being a tax col-
lector in the Ottoman-ruled Greek port of Kavala. In 1801 he 
enlisted as a mercenary in the Ottoman army sent to reoccupy 
Egypt,  the  French  expeditionary  army  under  Napoleon  having 
wiped  out  the  old  Mamluke  regime,  before  itself  surrender-
ing to the British navy. By 1803 Muhammed Ali commanded 
a  regiment  of  his  ethnically  Albanian  fellow  countrymen.  The  
Ottoman governor of Egypt ran short of cash. No longer able to 
afford  them,  he  dismissed  his  Albanian  troops.  They  mutinied 
and took over the government, and a scramble ensued.

Somehow Muhammed Ali wound up on top. He retained the 
loyalty of his Albanians and managed to suppress both Turkish 
and Egyptian fighters. He then received at least the temporary 
blessing  of  the  Ottoman  sultan,  Selim  III  the  Reformer  (who 
shortly thereafter was deposed, imprisoned, and murdered by his 
own janissary guardsmen). Muhammed Ali looked northwest at 
Europe and east to India. He ruled a prosperous kingdom—but 
he saw that Europeans might do to his or his children’s kingdom 
what they had done to India.

So Muhammed Ali strove to make Egypt great, introducing 
new crops, land reform, a modern military, a focus on export-
ing cotton, and the construction of state-owned textile factories 

121

to jump-start Egyptian industry. He understood that unless he 
could keep the machines working, his great-grandchildren would 
become the puppets of French bankers and British proconsuls. 
But  the  machines  could  not  be  kept  working.  Was  it  because 
Egypt did not train enough engineers? Was it because the bosses 
were state employees? Was it because the policy was not pursued 
long enough, and when Egypt’s military came under pressure it 
became  irresistibly  attractive  in  the  short  run  to  buy  weapons, 
ammunition, and uniforms from abroad?9

Muhammed  Ali  died  in  1849.  Had  his  progeny  shared  his 
worries, they might have reformed sufficiently to educate Egyp-
tians  capable  of  fixing  those  machines.  But  in  Egypt  it  was 
Muhammed Ali’s personal project, not an intergenerational, na-
tionalist one.10

In 1863, six years before the completion of the Suez Canal, 
Muhammed Ali’s grandson Ismail took the throne of Egypt as 
khedive at the age of thirty-three. Educated in France, open to 
European influences, and eager to modernize his country, he was 
also lucky. He became ruler of Egypt in the middle of the “cot-
ton famine” created by the American Civil War. The temporary 
disappearance  of  the  American  South  from  the  world’s  cotton 
supply resulted in a cotton boom everywhere else. The working 
textile factories of the Industrial Revolution needed cotton, and 
their owners were willing to pay almost any price for it. Egypt 
grew cotton. And so for a few years it seemed as though Egypt’s 
economic resources and wealth were inexhaustible.

They weren’t.
The Egyptian government declared bankruptcy in 1876. The 
creditors of the khedive became Egypt’s rulers. Ismail abdicated. 
Two  financial  controllers—one  British,  one  French—were  ap-
pointed  with  substantial  control  over  taxes  and  expenditures. 
Their task was to make sure that Egypt, now governed by Ismail’s 
son,  kept  up  revenue  and  paid  off  its  debt.  The  heavily  taxed 
Egyptians wondered why they were being made to pay off debts

run up by their extravagant ex-khedive. British troops restored 
order in 1882, and thereafter the khedive was a British puppet. 
On varying pretexts, British troops stayed in Egypt until 1956.

So  Muhammed  Ali’s  great-grandchildren  did  become  pup-

pets of French bankers and British proconsuls.11

China, too, offers important insight.
Poor and disorganized in 1870, imperial China was a coun-
try where the government and the economy were in crisis. Over 
more than two centuries of rule, the government of the ethnically 
Manchu Qing dynasty had trained its ethnically Han Confucian 
landlord-bureaucrat-scholar  aristocracy  to  be  incapable  of  tak-
ing effective action. After all, effective action might be directed 
against  the  Central  Government  Security  Perimeter  (which  is, 
perhaps, how we ought to translate what was back then translated 
as “Forbidden City”).

One such, born in 1823 to a scholar-gentry family in a vil-
lage about 150 miles west of Shanghai, was Li Hongzhang. The 
grind of studying the Confucian-school literary classics and pass-
ing the examinations was a hard and grueling one. In 1847, af-
ter  intensive  study  under  a  tutor  from  Hunan,  Zeng  Guofan, 
Li succeeded. Filial piety required Zeng to return to Hunan to 
mourn his mother in 1851, just as the Taiping Rebellion broke 
out. The bureaucrat-commanded army was useless, the suppos-
edly  elite  Manchu  “banners”  of  the  dynasty  equally  so.  Zeng, 
desperate to save the situation he found himself in the middle 
of, turned out to have a great talent for military organization. 
He recruited, trained, and commanded a volunteer army—the 
Xiang Army—to resist the Taiping rebels. Li Hongzhang went 
along and became one of the dynasty’s few competent generals.
By 1864 the Taiping Rebellion was suppressed, and Li was 
sent on to suppress another group of rebels, the Nian. By 1870, 
he was a diplomat trying to calm the French after the murder 
in a riot of sixty Catholic priests, nuns, and congregation mem-
bers, along with the French consul in Tianjin. In 1875 he led

the muscle in a military semi-coup upon the death of Emperor 
Tongzhi, to make sure that the four-year-old Guangxu, nephew 
of  Dowager  Empress  Cixi,  ascended  the  throne.  Li  had  been 
trained to be a bureaucrat, applying two-thousand-year-old phil-
osophical principles to questions of governance. But he found 
that the skills that mattered were (a) generalship, and (b) being 
able to turn away the wrath of and procure the aid of European 
imperial powers.

Many Western China specialists see and can almost touch an 
alternative history—one in which late nineteenth-century China 
stood up economically, politically, and organizationally. Japan, 
after all, won its short war against Russia in 1905, negotiated as 
an equal with Britain and the United States over warship con-
struction in 1921, and was perhaps the eighth industrial power in 
the world by 1929.12

We economists are much more skeptical. We note the cor-
rupt  and  incompetent  bureaucracies  that  failed  to  manage  the 
Yellow River dikes and the Grand Canal. We note that the Qing 
could not get their local officials to collect the salt tax. We note 
that when, in the mid-1880s, the Qing dynasty, having bought 
foreign metalworking machinery and built a navy, arsenals, and 
docks, thought it was strong enough to oppose the French con-
quest  of  Vietnam,  its  fleet  was  destroyed  in  an  hour.  And  we 
note that when, in 1895, the Qing dynasty thought it was strong 
enough to oppose the Japanese extension of their sphere of influ-
ence to Korea, it was, again, wrong. The Treaty of Shimonoseki 
added Taiwan, Korea, and southern Manchuria to Japan’s sphere 
of influence.

Furthermore, we economists note that even as late as 1929 
China  produced  only  20,000  tons  of  steel,  less  than  2  ounces 
per person, and 400,000 tons of iron, or 1.6 pounds per person. 
Meanwhile, it mined 27 million tons of coal, or 100 pounds per 
person. Compare this to America’s 700 pounds of steel per capita 
in the same year or 200 pounds in 1900, or to America’s 8,000

pounds of coal per capita in 1929 or 5,000 pounds of coal per 
capita in 1900.

Narrow the viewscope to one mine, the Kaiping coal mine in 
northern China. There we see general, diplomat, and governor Li 
Hongzhang at work in the 1880s. He saw that China needed in-
dustrial muscle. And so he became the prime bureaucratic mover 
behind  the  coal  mine,  as  well  as  behind  a  number  of  China’s 
other “self-strengthening efforts,” such as the 1878 cotton mills 
in Shanghai, the Tianjin arsenal, the telegraph between Tianjin 
and Peking, and more. Men who were as focused as Li was on 
economic development could make things happen.13

But  they  could  not  work  through  the  bureaucracy  and  get 
anything done. Li had commissioned a wealthy Hong Kong mer-
chant, Tang Tingshu, to build the Kaiping mine. What he had 
sought was a large, modern, industrial mine that could help mod-
ernize the nation. But they faced unusual forms of opposition. A 
vice president of the Board of Civil Offices, Chi Shihehang, de-
clared that “mining methods angered the earth dragon . . . [and 
so] the late empress could not rest quietly in her grave.” Li had to 
choose between abandoning his idea of building a modern coal 
mine—and with it the fuel to power steam engines—or accepting 
blame for any deaths or diseases that might strike the imperial 
family. Very bravely—considering the large size of the imperial 
family and the high death rate of the time—he chose modernity.
Production began in 1881. By 1889, 3,000 workers in three 
shifts  were  producing  700  tons  of  coal  a  day.  By  1900,  9,000 
workers were producing, but only a quarter of what was expected 
of miners in the United States or Australia. The mine was both 
a public governmental project and a private capitalist enterprise. 
The mine director was both an employee of the company’s Hong 
Kong  shareholders  and  an  official  of  the  Qing  administrative 
bureaucracy.

The  mine’s  director-general,  Tang  Tingshu,  died  in  1892. 
His  replacement,  Chang  Li—called  “Yenmao”  in  virtually  all

English-language  sources—was  neither  a  merchant,  nor  an  in-
dustrialist, nor an engineer, nor a manager. Chang was a political 
fixer—another key mover in the semi-coup of 1875—for the Em-
press Cixi. But Chang was arguably the wealthiest man in Tianjin 
by 1900. Maintaining the favor and patronage network that sup-
ported the Qing court was a higher priority than effective man-
agement. The mine had become a source of income for the well 
connected, rather than an important piece of an industrialization 
program. Li Hongzhang died in 1901, after one last round of dip-
lomatic fencing with the European imperial powers, who wanted 
to  be  paid  handsomely  for  suppressing  the  “Boxer”—“Fighters 
United for Justice” would be a better translation—Rebellion.

In  1901,  twenty-six-year-old  expatriate  mining  engineer 
and future US president Herbert Hoover took over the mine. 
Hoover claimed that the 9,000-worker payroll had been padded 
by 6,000 names, and that the director of personnel doing the 
padding (and collecting the wages) had bribed Chang Li hand-
somely for the post.

“Wait,” you say. “Herbert Hoover took over?”
Yes. Hoover arrived in Tientsin in 1900 just in time to be 
besieged in the city by the Boxer Rebellion. There Chang Li had 
fled, rightly fearing that the Boxers would execute him as a cor-
rupt puppet of the Europeans, and that the besieged Europeans 
wanted to imprison him for passing intelligence to the Boxers.

From this point forward things become cloudy, as nearly all 
narrators  become  unreliable,  desperate  in  various  ways  to  ap-
pear in a good light. Somehow Hoover got Chang released from 
prison.  Somehow  Chang  gave  Hoover  a  power  of  attorney  to 
reincorporate the Kaiping mine as a British-flag enterprise con-
trolled completely by Herbert Hoover. The historian Ellsworth 
Carlson reported that the local British chargé d’affaires was dis-
gusted. Hoover and company had “made a pretty pile at the ex-
pense of the Chinese,” he said, and while “legally the Board of 
Directors were unassailable . . . morally they were in the wrong.”

Britain shouldn’t countenance “a financial transaction which had 
fleeced  Chinese  shareholders,”  the  chargé  d’affaires  continued, 
and “lined the pockets of an Anglo-Belgian gang,” all under the 
orchestration of “a Yankee man of straw.”

None  of  which  Herbert  Hoover  would  have  agreed  with. 
More  than  a  century  later  we  can  try  to  read  Hoover’s  mind. 
Perhaps he thought the old shareholders should be grateful that 
he and his partners had only charged them 62.5 percent of the 
company; after all, the alternative was for the Russians to have 
confiscated  the  entire  mine  as  war  reparations,  leaving  the  old 
shareholders with zero. Perhaps he thought that Chang Li was a 
corrupt thief, while Hoover would make the mine run produc-
tively and profitably. Indeed, Hoover managed to nearly triple 
the value of the old stockholders’ shares: the 37.5 percent he left 
them was worth more than the 100 percent the old stockholders 
had owned before.

We again hear echoes of our whispering chorus. The imper-
sonal market had taken from some, given to others, and greatly 
increased the total; blessed be the market. But the local chargé 
d’affaires heard something else: Man—in this case one Herbert 
Hoover—took and gave, not the market. Some—especially the 
new European stockholders who now owned the majority of the 
mine, and who now received the profits that Li Hongzhang had 
intended as part of the basis for a great economic leap forward for 
China and all its people—might bless the man; but others—say, 
the Boxers who had rebelled, and the Qing dynasty officials who 
found their room to maneuver against imperialist would-be con-
querors diminished—would curse him.

And,  by  extension,  the  unhappy  and  rebellious  would  also 
curse  a  social-economic  structure  that  could  not  find  and  pro-
mote competent executives but instead advanced corrupt polit-
ical fixers; a political-ritual culture that required one of the few 
modernizing regional governors to focus his attention constantly 
on the enterprise to keep it on-track, and to run interference in

order to protect it from reactionaries; and an educational system 
that churned out literati instead of engineers, and that meant the 
country required foreign technical personnel for everything. But 
their  curses  changed  little  in  the  world  around  them.  Outside 
of the charmed circles near ports created by the extraterritorial 
foreign concessions, and to a slight degree in regions within the 
control  of  the  few  modernizing  governors,  modern  industries 
simply did not develop and modern technologies simply were not 
applied in late imperial China.

Visionary reforming politician Sun Yat-sen, who had offered 
his services to Li Hongzhang in 1894 only to be rebuffed, built 
up  a  financial  and  propaganda  network  among  Chinese  emi-
grants beyond the reach of the government. Military politicians, 
such as Yuan Shikai, concluded that working with the Manchu 
court  was  useless.  In  1912,  Sun  Yat-sen  launched  a  rebellion, 
which  Yuan  Shikai  and  his  peers  refused  to  suppress,  and  the 
Qing dynasty fell.

The  six-year-old  emperor  abdicated.  Yuan  Shikai  declared 
himself  president  of  the  subsequent  republic  and  tried  to  seize 
control of the country. China descended into near-anarchy.

There are many, many more stories I could tell of Europe’s 
empires in the late 1800s and of how the colonized and the nearly 
colonized  tried  to  respond.  But  India,  Egypt,  and  China  con-
vey much of the picture. The power, real and threatened, of the 
formal empires of the North Atlantic, with all their wealth and 
influence, meant that at the start of the long twentieth century, 
even  those  who  were  not  formally  colonized  were  nevertheless 
dominated by informal empire—overwhelmingly by the British. 
It was a world in which offers were made that could not, realisti-
cally or prudently, be refused.

Perhaps  the  offers  could  not  be  refused  because  the  conse-
quences  of  accepting  them  were  so  good.  Perhaps  they  could 
not be refused because the consequences of not accepting them

were so bad. As the twentieth-century socialist economist Joan 
Robinson liked to say, the only thing worse than being exploited 
by  the  capitalists  was  not  being  exploited  by  the  capitalists— 
being ignored by them, and placed outside the circuits of pro-
duction and exchange.

There was also, of course, the question of who exactly bore 
the consequences of refusing a particular offer. Would it be the 
country’s ruling elite, its current citizens, or their descendants? 
Generally,  attitudes  split  along  Hayekian  and  Polanyian  lines: 
those who found that the market gaveth, blessed be the market 
(and some percent of imperialism); and those who found that the 
market tooketh, cursed be the men who deprived the people of 
bread, shelter, or dignity.

It was easier to decide who to bless and who to curse when 
it  came  to  the  formal  mode  of  empire.  In  the  first  decades  of 
the  long  twentieth  century,  however,  making  such  distinctions 
became increasingly difficult as the informal mode of the Brit-
ish Empire—and to a lesser extent of other European empires—
gained power. Such are the benefits of hegemony, which had four 
important aspects: free trade, concentrated industry, free migra-
tion, and freedom of investment.

It was technically possible, of course, to resist the advances of 
informal empire. But to refuse an offer often meant calling down 
upon  yourself  your  own  people’s  retribution.  Afghanistan  may 
indeed be where empires go to die, but it has also proved a grave 
for  social  progress,  technological  advancements,  and  longevity. 
Most of the nation-states that were extended offers they couldn’t 
refuse ultimately agreed to play by Britain’s rules—broadly, for 
three reasons.

First,  playing  by  those  rules  was  what  Britain  was  doing, 
and Britain was clearly worth emulating. The hope was that by 
adopting the policies of an obviously successful economy, you—
that is, the government—could make your economy successful,

too. Second, trying to play by other rules—say, protecting your 
handmade textile sector—was very expensive. Britain and com-
pany could supply commodities and industrial goods cheaply as 
well  as  luxuries  that  were  unattainable  elsewhere.  And  Britain 
and  company  would  pay  handsomely  for  primary  product  ex-
ports.  Finally,  even  if  you  sought  to  play  by  other  rules,  your 
control over what was going on in your country was limited. And 
there was a great deal of money to be made.

Playing by the rules of the international economic game had 

consequences.

The first, an aspect of globalization and free trade, was that 
steam-driven machinery provided a competitive advantage that 
handicrafts could not match, no matter how low workers’ wages. 
And with very few exceptions, steam-driven machinery worked 
reliably  only  in  the  global  north.  Manufacturing  declined  out-
side  the  industrial  core,  and  peripheral  labor  was  shifted  into 
agriculture and other primary products. And as a consequence, 
the global periphery was “underdeveloped.” Gaining in the short 
run from advantageous terms of trade, the peripheral states were 
unable to build communities of engineering practice that might 
provide a path to greater, industrial riches.

An  essential  secondary  consequence  was  that  steam-driven 
machinery worked reliably and steadily enough to be profitable 
only in the global north. The “reliably” and the “profitable” parts 
required three things: a community of engineering practice, a lit-
erate labor force that could be trained to use industrial technol-
ogy, and sufficient finances to provide the necessary maintenance, 
repair, and support services.14

Another consequence was the mostly free system of migration 
in the early years of the long twentieth century (save for Asians 
seeking  to  migrate  to  temperate-zone  economies).  Finally,  free 
trade  and  free  migration  made  possible  by  Europe’s  informal 
imperial  domination  helped  to  enrich  the  world  greatly  in  the

generations before World War I. Free capital flows, through the 
freedom of investment, greased the wheels.

You could lend to whomever you wished. You could borrow 
from  whomever  you  wished.  But,  before  World  War  I,  it  was 
understood that you would at least try to pay it back. Certainly 
those  economies  that  received  inflows  of  capital  before  World 
War I benefited enormously if they had the labor, the skill, and the 
organizational resources to take advantage of them. For the United 
States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, and perhaps others, such as 
India, the availability of large amounts of capital—largely Brit-
ish-financed capital—to speed development of industry and in-
frastructure was a godsend. It sped the construction of railroads 
and infrastructure and the development of industry.

It is not clear that the free flow of capital benefited those 
exporting it. France subsidized the pre–World War I industri-
alization of czarist Russia in the belief that someday it would 
fight another war with Germany (correct) and that victory de-
pended on a large, active, allied Russian army forcing Germany 
to fight a two-front war (not so correct). Before World War I, 
buying Russian bonds became a test of French patriotism. But 
after the war, there was no czar ruling from Moscow—there was 
only Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who had no interest in repaying the 
czar’s creditors.

One other way that informal empire exercised its influence 
was by providing the rest of the world with an example to em-
ulate. This was most notably the case with the British Empire. 
British  institutions  and  practices  appeared  to  be—had  in  fact 
been—stunningly successful. Emulating them, at least on a trial 
basis, made compelling sense, whether that meant wearing busi-
ness  suits,  translating  Latin  verse  in  school,  establishing  strong 
property rights, or investing in railroads and ports. Most of this 
was of substantial use elsewhere in the world. Some of it was not. 
And it would turn out that what had fit British circumstances in 

131

the mid-1800s fit the governments and economies of the periph-
ery less and less successfully as the long century unfolded.

So  stood  most  of  the  periphery  to  the  North  Atlantic  eco-
nomic core during the years of formal and informal empire. The 
pattern, which played out in India, Egypt, China, and elsewhere, 
seemed so common as to be declared the stuff of providence and 
nature. But there was one exception.

Alone  among  the  non-European  world  before  1913,  Japan 
managed to deal with the imperialists, prosper, industrialize, and 
join them.

To understand exactly what happened in Japan, we must look 
at least as far back as an early seventeenth-century daimyo warrior 
prince,  Tokugawa  Ieyasu,  who  was  granted  the  title  of  shogun, 
that is, viceroy for the priest-emperor in all civil and military mat-
ters, in 1603. His son Hidetaka and grandson Iemitsu consoli-
dated the new regime. From its capital, Edo—later Tokyo—the 
Tokugawa Shogunate ruled Japan for two and a half centuries.15
From the start, the shogunate looked with caution south to 
the Philippines. Only a century before, the Philippines had been 
made up of independent kingdoms. Then the Europeans landed. 
Merchants  had  been  followed  by  missionaries.  Converts  had 
proved an effective base of popular support for European influ-
ence. Missionaries had been followed by soldiers. And by 1600, 
Spain ruled the Philippines.

The Tokugawa Shogunate was confident that it could con-
trol its potential rivals and subjects in Japan. It was not confident 
that it could resist the technology, military, and religious power 
of the Europeans. And so the country was closed: trade was re-
stricted to a very small number of ships, and these were allowed 
access  to  the  Port  of  Nagasaki  only.  Japanese  subjects  return-
ing from abroad were executed; foreigners discovered outside of 
the restricted zone were executed; and Christianity was violently 
suppressed. For centuries formal empire struggled, and failed, to 
gain a foothold.

Another factor differentiating Japan was that one in six Japa-
nese were urban. As of 1868, Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo together 
had two million people. Half of adult men were literate: in 1868, 
there were more than six hundred bookshops in Tokyo. And lit-
eracy  and  urbanization  laid  the  groundwork  for  technological 
competence.

The historian Robert Allen tells the story of the Lord of Naga-
saki, Nabeshima Naomasa, and his cannon foundry. His workers 
acquired and then translated a Dutch description of a foundry. 
They then set out to copy it: “In 1850, they succeeded in build-
ing  a  reverberatory  furnace,  and  three  years  later  were  casting 
cannon. In 1854, the Nagasaki group imported state-of-the-art, 
breech-loading Armstrong guns from Britain and manufactured 
copies. By 1868, Japan had eleven furnaces casting iron.”16

But  the  Tokugawa  era  came  to  an  end  in  1868  with  the 
Meiji  Restoration.  Rule  was  grasped  by  a  shifting  coalition  of 
notables— most  prominently,  at  first,  the  “Meiji  Six”—Mori 
Arinori,  Ōkubo  Toshimichi,  Saigō  Takamori,  Itō  Hirobumi, 
Yamagata Aritomo, and Kido Takayoshi—who were interested 
in  absorbing  European  technology  while  maintaining  Japanese 
civilization and independence.17 The ambition was transparent. 
In  the  four- character  slogans  that  the  Meiji  Restorers  used  to 
communicate with the country as a whole, Wakon yosai (Western 
learning with Japanese spirit), would be adopted in the interest of 
creating Fukoku kyōhei (a rich country with a strong army).

There followed the rapid adoption of Western organization: 
prefects,  bureaucratic  jobs,  newspapers,  language  standardiza-
tion on Tokyo samurai dialect, an education ministry, compul-
sory school attendance, military conscription, railways built by 
the government, the abolition of internal customs barriers to a 
national market, fixed-length hours of the working day to im-
prove coordination, and the Gregorian calendar, all in place by 
1873.  Representative  local  government  was  in  place  by  1879. 
A  bicameral  parliament  (with  a  newly  created  peerage)  and  a

constitutional  monarchy  were  in  place  by  1889.  By  1890,  80 
percent of school-age children were at least enrolled.

In China, Li Hongzhang had been one of the few able to 
swim against the institutional and cultural tide to push modern-
ization and industrialization forward. In Japan there were many 
such  men.  One  of  the  Meiji  Six  was  Itō  Hirobumi.  In  1863, 
the  Choshu  clan  elders  decided  they  desperately  needed  to 
learn more about European organization and technology, so— 
illegally—they smuggled five of their promising young students 
out of Japan to travel and study in Europe. Itō worked for 130 
days as a deckhand on the sailing ship Pegasus before arriving 
in England, where he studied at University College in London. 
He cut his studies short after only six months and returned to 
Choshu to argue stridently against a policy of confronting the 
imperial powers: Japan was too weak, he said, and the organiza-
tional and technological gap too large.

By 1870, Itō was in the United States, studying money and 
banking. The next year, he went back to Japan, where he wrote 
the regulations for the commutation of feudal dues and their re-
placement by a general system of national taxation. By 1873, he 
had become minister of industry, tasked with reverse- engineering 
as much European technology as possible and building telegraph 
lines, streetlights, textile mills, railroads, shipyards, lighthouses, 
mines,  steel  foundries,  glassworks,  the  Imperial  College  of  En-
gineering,  and  more.18  In  1881,  he  muscled  his  contemporary 
Ōkuma Shigenobu out of the government and in so doing be-
came the informal prime minister of Japan; four years later, he 
became the first formal prime minister of Japan, under a consti-
tution he had written based on the model of Prussia’s in 1850.

Itō launched the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895. With eleven 
European-built and two Japanese-built warships, and with an army 
trained  by  a  Prussian  major,  Jakob  Meckel,  Japan  quickly  won.

Arthur—fell to a frontal Japanese assault in one day. Korea and 
Taiwan were grabbed as Japanese protectorates.

In 1902, Japan allied itself with Britain, seeking the role of 
Britain’s viceroy in the North Pacific. Three years later, Japan 
again  went  to  war,  this  time  with  Russia,  a  conflict  the  Japa-
nese  won  decisively,  bringing  Manchuria  into  their  sphere  of 
influence.

In 1909, Itō Hirobumi met his end, assassinated by Korean 
nationalist An Jung-geun. In response, Japan formally annexed 
Korea in 1910.

It was not just the Meiji Six. There were many others who 
played important roles in shaping a more modern Japan. Taka-
hashi  Korekiyo,  for  example,  born  in  1854  as  the  illegitimate 
son  of  a  Tokugawa  court  artist,  sailed  to  Oakland,  California, 
in 1867 to work as a laborer and learn English. He returned and 
began to work his way up the bureaucracy (while also temporar-
ily crossing the Pacific again, this time to Peru, to fail at min-
ing silver), becoming vice president of the Bank of Japan, selling 
bonds  to  finance  the  Russo-Japanese  War  of  1905,  becoming 
president  of  the  Bank  of  Japan,  and  then,  in  1921,  becoming 
prime minister. Upward mobility was a powerful possibility in 
Meiji Restoration– era Japan. Takahashi acquired knowledge of 
the levers of mod  ern finance without having been inculcated into 
the cult of financial orthodoxy. This was to matter later on, for 
when the Great Depression of the 1930s started, Takahashi was 
finance minister, and was able to look at the situation with un-
blinkered eyes and set Japan on a course that allowed it to escape 
the Great Depression almost entirely.19

How did Japan manage it?
Economic historian Robert Allen believes the industrial econ-
omies that developed successfully before 1900 focused the power 
of government on creating four, and only four, institutional pre-
requisites: railways and ports, education, banks, and a shielding

tariff  on  industries  where  their  future  comparative  advantage 
would lie—if they could get there.

Imperial powers prohibited Meiji Japan from imposing tariffs 
on imports of greater than 5 percent. But the Japanese govern-
ment, then and after, was willing to substitute. It did not so much 
“pick winners” as recognize winners—successful exporters—and 
subsidize  them.  When  the  Ministry  of  Industry  established  Ja-
pan’s railway and telegraph systems, it also established a school 
to train Japanese engineers. And it relied as much as possible on 
domestic suppliers. Meiji Japan did not have large-scale banks. 
But it did have some very wealthy merchant clans willing to move 
into  industry:  Mitsui,  Mitsubishi,  Sumitomo,  Yasuda.  Lastly, 
Meiji military politicians focused on preparing the logistical tail 
to defend Japan and to conquer an empire in the age of steel and 
steam.  Even  before  cotton-textile  industrialization  began,  mili-
tary industrialization was underway: shipyards, arsenals, and their 
linkages  employed  perhaps  ten  thousand  industrial  workers  by 
the early 1880s.20

It was a near thing, however. Outlier Japan was an outlier by 
luck as much as by determination. In 1910, manufacturing was 
still  only  one-fifth  of  the  nation’s  GDP,  and  in  the  preceding 
decade, Japan was only a semi-industrial civilization. It had, how-
ever,  accomplished  something  unique:  it  had  transferred  a  sig-
nificant amount of industrial technology outside of the charmed 
circles of the North Atlantic and had the expertise necessary to 
keep it running and profitable.

EMPIRES,  FORMAL  AND  INFORMAL,  both  accelerated  and  re-
tarded economic growth and development throughout the global 
south. But on balance, empire did more to retard than to advance. 
After all, the business of empire was not economic development. 
The business of empire was . . . empire.

Within the industrial core, the conservative view was that em-
pires were ordained by God—or at least were morally required. 
Let us give the mic to Rudyard Kipling:

Take up the White Man’s burden—
Send forth the best ye breed—
Go send your sons to exile
To serve your captives’ need
To wait in heavy harness
On fluttered folk and wild—
Your new-caught, sullen peoples
Half devil and half child.21

Those “sullen” “captives” you were being sent off to civilize 
might  not  like  it.  “Half  devil  and  half  child,”  these  “wild . . .  
new-caught people” were definitely not your equals. And what 
you were being sent off to do wasn’t any fun, but rather “exile,” 
“burden,”  and  “heavy  harness.”  But  still,  for  some  reason,  you 
needed to do it.

The enlightened liberal belief in the early 1900s was that this 
made little sense. The belief was that the then-existing empires were 
little but confidence games, and that they were on their last legs.

The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter thought the peo-
ple were being conned—diverted to cheering for victories so they 
would  not  notice  that  the  landlord-aristocratic  political  power 
structure  made  no  sense.22  He  thought  the  landlord-aristocrats 
were being conned, too: sent to die of dysentery, wound-caused 
infection, or shot and shell, when they could, instead, be drinking 
cappuccinos with whipped cream at the Café Central at Herren-
gasse 14 in Vienna.

Empire  was  the  equivalent  of  a  modern-day  sports  team, 
whose  victories  kicked  off  celebrations—such  as  the  immense 
Mafeking Night party in Britain, which was kicked off by good

news about British progress in the South African Boer War. The 
military aristocracy loved to play, and the people loved to watch.
Schumpeter  hated  this.  And  he  thought  that  it  was  on  the 
way  out—that  as  people  became  richer  and  more  prosperous,  
the bourgeois virtues would win, and the drive for empire would 
die.  Schumpeter  expected  the  con  to  end,  and  a  peaceful,  less  
aristocratic, less imperial, less bloodthirsty twentieth century.

He was wrong.
The British activist John Hobson had a different take on the 
driver of imperialism—that it was economics, rather than culture 
and  sociology,  that  was  the  primary  factor.23  Hobson  thought 
that having the government spend money putting people to work 
building weapons, and then using the weapons to conquer colo-
nies that could be forced to buy exports, was a way of avoiding 
mass unemployment, and so keeping domestic political peace—
albeit a highly suboptimal way.

As Hobson saw it, a government’s main task was to keep its 
people working and prosperous and happy. And its main obsta-
cles  in  doing  this  were  disruptive  business  cycles,  which  could 
cause mass unemployment. Empire managed to overcome these 
obstacles in two ways: first, by equipping the military needed to 
maintain the empire, which put people to work; and second, by 
taking advantage of the fact that empire is a good source of con-
sumers for the products of domestic factories. European govern-
ments that pursued empire, Hobson thought, were less likely to 
face economic distress, and so more likely to hang on to power. 
The solution to empire, he thought, would be more equality at 
home. This would translate into smaller business cycles, less un-
employment, and less need for empire.

And Hobson thought that a pro-democratic, pro-equality po-
litical shift was coming, and that in its aftermath war and empire 
would lose their purpose, giving way to a peaceful, more egalitar-
ian,  more  democratic,  less  imperial,  less  bloodthirsty  twentieth 
century.

He, too, was wrong.
The British public intellectual Norman Angell thought that 
empire and war—except, perhaps, for wars of national liberation 
to give people self-government—were already pointless and ob-
solete.24 And he firmly believed that governments could not be so 
inept or so shortsighted not to realize that.

He was wrong as well.
The same forces that propelled European powers to empire 
would  propel  them  to  destructive  industrial  war,  and  in  1914 
those forces would turn Europe into a truly dark continent. The 
history  of  the  long  twentieth  century  took  its  very  sharp  mili-
taristic turn. The question was: Would that turn negate all the 
progress in world civilization since 1870?

World War I

Perhaps the saddest book on my bookshelf is Norman Angell’s 

The  Great  Illusion—the  retitled  version  of  Europe’s  Optical 
Illusion, first published in 1909. It could well take pride of place 
within the “they didn’t see it coming” genre. What draws forth 
tears in the twenty-first century is that we know all too well what 
in fact came to pass and the profound wish that the many, many 
readers of Angell’s book had acted on its wisdom rather than only 
marveling at it.

The illusion that gave Angell’s book its title was that war and 
territorial conquest were the 2main means of moral and material 
progress: “If a nation’s wealth is really subject to military con-
fiscation,” he wrote in his follow-up volume, Peace Theories and 
the Balkan War, then “small states should be insecure indeed,” 
and  “the  Austrian  should  be  better  off  than  the  Switzer.”  But 
this  wasn’t  the  case.  For  one  example,  Angell  noted  that  “Bel-
gian national [government bonds] stand 20 points higher than 
the German,” despite Belgium’s much smaller size and negligible 
global military power. “It is such quite simple questions as these, 
and the quite plain facts which underlie them which will lead to 
sounder conceptions in this matter [of conquest for gain] on the 
part of the peoples.”1

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

If  sound  conceptions  were  arrived  at  by  attention  to  plain 

facts, he would have had a point.

It  was,  Angell  rightly  argued,  much  cheaper  to  make  and 
trade for what you want than to build military power and spill the 
blood of your own people in order to extract it from others. Using 
war and empire to obtain a greater domain for the king to rule 
was, Angell thought, no longer a viable strategy for anyone—and 
was in fact profoundly stupid in the age of destructive industrial 
warfare. And using empire to make people worship the right God 
the right way was, Angell thought, another habit that humanity 
had outgrown.

He was right in his belief that war could no longer make any 
form of economic sense. But in his belief that therefore humanity 
had outgrown it, he was totally, disastrously wrong.

STORIES  HAVE  PROTAGONISTS.  THEY make most of the deci-
sions and take most of the actions. Telling protagonist-led stories 
is how we think. A prime minister like Otto von Bismarck—a 
protagonist—maneuvers  to  retain  power.  The  working  class—
another  kind  of  protagonist—decides  to  give  him  the  votes  of 
their parliamentary representatives in return for national health 
insurance. And Germany—a third kind of protagonist—chooses, 
precociously, to march down the road of social insurance and so-
cial democracy.2 Often this is pure metaphor: the ocean seeks to 
climb closer to the moon and so we feel the tides, or the lightning 
chooses to follow the path of least resistance to the ground. But 
we find it easiest to think this way. Perhaps this is the only way 
to think.

So at one level the history of the long twentieth century has 
two battling ideas as its protagonists. One is best associated with 
Friedrich  August  von  Hayek—the  market  giveth,  the  market  
taketh; blessed be the market. The other is best associated with 
Karl  Polanyi—the  market  is  made  for  man,  not  man  for  the

market. In the long twentieth century in which the economic and 
its repeated revolutionary transformations are dominant, nearly 
all of our other protagonists in all of our stories are profoundly 
shaped by at least one, perhaps both, of these ideas. This is as true 
for humanity as it is for Nikola Tesla or Bismarck or the German 
working class. What key sub-story protagonists made of Hayek’s 
and  Polanyi’s  notions,  how  they  contorted  them  and  imposed 
policies in light of them, made the difference.

Much  of  the  time,  the  processes  and  factors  of  history  can 
seem almost inevitable to us—the actions and decisions of partic-
ular individuals mostly offset one another, and if an opportunity 
was not seized by one person at one date it was soon enough seized 
by another. Or we have a sense that things could have turned out 
very differently, but we cannot point to a single moment when 
some individual decided to turn right instead of left, and so made 
the difference. Even as decisive and important an individual as 
Tesla simply turned one—very important—technological clock 
forward  by  a  decade.  Herbert  Hoover  and  Li  Hongzhang  and 
company are important as individuals, but they are historically 
decisive only to the extent that they stand for thousands, if not 
more, whose actions made imperialism, failed to put China on 
the road to rapid industrialization, and so on. But there are mo-
ments  when  particular  individuals  really  do  matter,  and  where 
choice and chance come to the front of the stage.

Two  chapters  ago  we  shifted  our  focus  from  economics  to 
political  economy:  we  needed  to  look  not  just  at  technology, 
production, organization, and exchange, but also at how people 
governing themselves and others tried to regulate the economy 
to preserve or produce a good society—or at least a society that 
would be good for them. In the previous chapter, we shifted our 
focus to imperial politics: we needed to look not just at how peo-
ples and their elites governed themselves, but at how they gov-
erned others. Each of these shifts narrowed our narrative focus. 
The protagonist humanity became the protagonist nation-states,

which in turn became the protagonists of the North Atlantic in-
dustrial core and the southern periphery. In this chapter we take a 
further step. We move to where choice and chance are dominant, 
into war, governance, and high politics. In this chapter, individ-
uals matter.

The world at the start of 1914 was growing at an unpreceden-
ted pace; it was substantially peaceful, and it was more prosperous 
than ever before—with problems, but prosperous. It was a world 
in which it was not irrational to be optimistic about human civ-
ilization. After World War I, the world, especially Europe, was 
different. For one thing, much of it was rubble and ashes. And we 
cannot attribute the difference to structures evolving in a logical 
and predictable way.

So how are we to grasp this illogical evolution of events, this 
upsetting of what we economic historians want to see as the nat-
ural pattern of human progress? I think a good place to start is a 
decade before Angell wrote The Great Illusion. Beginning in 1899, 
Britain waged a war of choice in South Africa, the Boer War.3

That it was a war of choice is clear from the British pattern 
of choosing otherwise in the preceding decades. From the 1860s, 
the  expansion  of  European  empires  was  coupled  with  a  will-
ingness  to  hand  over  power  to  locals—to  white  locals,  that  is:  
Canada in 1867, Australia in 1901, New Zealand in 1907. Indeed, 
that would be the choice with South Africa in 1910. But ten years 
earlier, in 1900, a different choice was made, one that eventually 
required  Britain  to  send  more  than  250,000  soldiers  to  South  
Africa to convince 200,000 Boers that they did not want to gov-
ern themselves but rather to be ruled from London.

The Dutch were the first European settlers to colonize south-
ern Africa, starting in 1652. The Boers were the descendants of 
these Dutch colonizers in the region. They came under British 
governance  at  the  dawn  of  the  nineteenth  century,  and,  un-
happy about it, founded their own republics, the Province of the

Transvaal and the Orange Free State. This was acceptable to the 
British for decades until it wasn’t.

The  British  colonial  secretary,  Joseph  Chamberlain—father 
of  1930s  prime  minister  Neville  Chamberlain—preached  the 
annexation of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. And in 
1899, he sent an ultimatum: equal rights for British citizens in 
the Transvaal (with consequences for resource extraction) or war.
What, after all, did the mightiest empire the world had ever 
seen have to fear from two small republics populated by unin-
dustrialized  farmers,  whose  prosperity  had  been  based  largely 
on their power to exploit the land’s earlier inhabitants, no mat-
ter their discovery of gold and mineral wealth? More than you 
would think. The Boer army attacked, besieging British garrisons 
in towns named Mafeking, Ladysmith, and Kimberley, and de-
feating  British  relief  columns  in  battles  at  places  named  Spion 
Kop,  Vaal  Kranz,  Magersfontein,  Stormberg,  and  the  Tugela 
River. Six hundred of Sir William Gatacre’s 3,000 troops were 
captured at Stormberg as British troops fled, after being ordered 
up a near-cliff against entrenched Boers with rifles. And 1,400 of 
Lord Methuen’s 14,000 men were killed or wounded at Magers-
fontein, as they assaulted the Boer trench line. Redvers Buller’s 
21,000 suffered 1,200 killed and wounded to the Boers’ 50 in a 
failed attempt to cross the Tugela River.

Short and victorious Joseph Chamberlain’s war was not.
Any  calculation  of  costs  and  benefits  would  have  told  the 
British cabinet to talk peace: it was time to stand down, in return 
for promises from the Boers to treat British miners and prospec-
tors as white people should be treated.

Instead,  a  quarter  of  a  million  British  soldiers  were  sent  to 
South Africa starting in February 1900. It was a vast number. Were 
the United States in 2021 to commit the proportional equivalent, 
it would come to 2 million soldiers. The choice to send over such 
a force gave the British overwhelming superiority: a five-to-one 

145

edge even over the entire Boer people-in-arms. And in addition 
the British sent a competent general—Field Marshal Lord Rob-
erts. The Orange Free State capital, Bloemfontein, fell on March 
13, 1900; Johannesburg fell on May 31; and Transvaal’s capital, 
Pretoria, fell on June 5.

But the war was not over. Defeated in open battle, the Boers 
turned to guerrilla warfare, waging an insurgency against the Brit-
ish  for  a  year  and  a  half—and  at  one  point  they  captured  the 
British second-in-command, Lord Methuen.

What  does  an  invading  military  superpower  do  when  its 
troops are faced with a guerrilla insurgency in a land where they 
do not speak the language? The British Empire invented the mod-
ern concentration camp. Are guerrillas active in an area? Round 
up everyone—men, women, and children—and stick them be-
hind barbed wire. Don’t feed them too well, and don’t spend too 
much time worrying about sanitation. Then build small forts and 
construct wire fences to reduce the guerrillas’ mobility.

Roughly 30,000 Boers, most of them children under sixteen, 
died in the concentration camps. Nearly 100,000 people died in 
the Boer War. In addition to the 30,000 Boer civilians who died, 
perhaps 8,000 British soldiers died in battle, another 14,000 died 
of disease, and 10,000 Boer soldiers died. On top of that, perhaps 
30,000  indigenous  Africans  died—which,  grotesquely,  nobody 
counted at the time.

All in all, Britain mobilized 2.5 percent of its adult male pop-

ulation for the war, and about one in ten of those men died.

Would  it  not  have  been  better  if  all  this  could  have  been 

avoided? We might think so. Most of Britain didn’t.

The  1900  British  general  election  was  a  huge  political  vic-
tory for the warmongering Conservatives, who were led by Lord 
Salisbury: it was called a “khaki election” because of the army’s 
uniforms,  and  the  term  has  stuck  to  denote  any  election  heav-
ily influenced by war. A peace treaty was signed in 1902 annex-
ing the two Boer republics to the British Empire. But by 1910,

when South Africa became a white self-governing dominion, with 
Afri  kaans and English both named as official languages, it was in-
habited with a voting population about as well disposed toward 
Westminster as, well, the population of Ireland was in 1910.4

What was wrong with all those voting British? Why didn’t 
the  people  on  the  ground  think  a  negotiated  peace  to  a  white 
self-governing dominion wouldn’t have been better? Because they 
were nationalists.

What is a nationalist? Well, the venerated German social sci-
entist and (for his day) liberal Max Weber, for one. In his inau-
gural  lecture  as  professor  at  Frieburg  university  in  1895,  “The 
National State and Economic Policy,” Weber, a German sociolo-
gist, summarized the worldview that he shared with many others:

We all consider the German character of the East as some-
thing  that  should  be  protected. . . . The  German  peasants 
and day-labourers of the East are not being pushed off the 
land  in  an  open  conflict  by  politically-superior  opponents. 
Instead, they are getting the worst of it in the silent and dreary 
struggle of everyday economic existence, they are abandoning 
their homeland to a race which stands on a lower level, and 
moving towards a dark future in which they will sink without 
trace. . . . Our successors will not hold us responsible before 
history for the kind of economic organization we hand over 
to them, but rather for the amount of elbow-room we con-
quer for them in the world.5

Weber was a dark-haired and square-headed Caucasian male 
who spoke German. He greatly feared dark-haired, square-headed 
Caucasian  males  who  spoke  Polish.  In  the  transparent  code  of  
nationalism,  this  fear  led  him  to  write,  “The  economic  policy  
of a German state, and that standard of value adopted by a Ger-
man  economic  theorist,  can  therefore  be  nothing  other  than  a 
German policy and a German standard.”

We  know  what  all  this  points  to.  We  will  spend  chapters  
on the consequences. But we can and should flash-forward. No 
individuals ever make their decisions in a vacuum. No individ-
uals  ever  make  their  decisions  impelled  mechanically  by  obvi-
ous material incentives or consequences. “Material interests may 
drive the trains down the tracks,” Weber liked to say, “but ideas  
are the switchmen,” the ones who throw the switches that deter-
mine which track the train follows.6 When one individual decides 
he would like to turn right, not left, toward some war of choice, 
say, it matters if a large portion of the individuals surrounding 
that decision maker are enmeshed in, if not in thrall to, the same 
notions  underlying  the  choice.  Nationalism  was  a  notion  that 
could not just swamp competing beliefs but pervert them.

We  see  this  at  the  level  of  the  individual.  Forty-eight  years 
after  Weber’s  speech,  the  largest  single  military  command  of  
German  speakers  ever—Adolf  Hitler’s  Heeresgruppe  Sud,  Army 
Group South—would be fighting even larger formations of the 
Red Army in Ukraine in a war seeking to win “elbow-room” for 
the German Volk. Its commander would be a man who had, at 
birth, been named Fritz Erich Georg Eduard von Lewinski.7

The “von” signifies that the name is a German noble name. 
But “Lewinski” (Levi-ski)—is not a name that springs from the 
Germanic branch of the Indo-European language tree. The suffix 
“-ski” is Slavic: it signifies that the name is a Polish noble name—
it’s  the  Polish  analog  to  the  German  “von.”  And  then  there  is 
what is in between the “von” and the “ski”: “Levi.”

There is not a more Jewish surname in the world than “Levi.”
Yet Fritz Erich Georg Eduard worked diligently and enthu-
siastically for Adolf Hitler, skillfully and tirelessly commanding 
soldiers who fought fanatically for a regime most focused on kill-
ing as many Jews (and almost as focused on killing enough Poles, 
Russians, and other Slavic peoples to gain “elbow-room” for Ger-
man farmers) as possible. The histories call him not von Lewinsky 
but “von Manstein.” This was because he was his mother Helene 

148

von Sperling’s tenth child and fifth son, and his mother’s sister 
Hedwig was childless, so Helene gave Fritz Erich Georg Eduard 
to Hedwig, and she and her husband von Manstein adopted him. 
It was under that name that he made his career in the Imperial, 
Weimar Republic, and Nazi armies.

Fritz Erich Georg Eduard von Manstein né von Lewinski was 
a nationalist. To him, just as for Max Weber and many others, 
the prospect of the “silent and dreary struggle” in the mixed bor-
derlands—where some people spoke German and others looking 
much the same spoke Polish—was unacceptable. He, and mil-
lions like him, believed this to such an extent that both Hayekian 
and Polanyian notions of any sort of peaceful market path to-
ward utopia shrank to near invisibility. The path to his becoming 
a soldier was well greased: the von Lewinskys, von Sperlings, and 
von Mansteins had five Prussian generals among them, including 
both of Erich’s grandparents. Helene and Hedwig’s sister Ger-
trude married Paul von Hindenberg, which made that field mar-
shal and right-wing Weimar Republic president Erich’s uncle.

In technologically advanced German cities such as Hamburg 
and  Essen,  industrialists  and  merchants  desperate  for  workers 
found that many potential workers were already engaged in agri-
cultural  employment  in  Pomerania  and  Prussia.  The  industri-
alists and merchants therefore offered them higher wages and a 
better life if they would move to the seaports and to the Rhine-
land,  and  many  did  exactly  that.  The  choices  of  industrialists 
and  merchants  translated  to  choices  for  agricultural  workers, 
which translated to choices for the landlords of the German East. 
Rather than matching the wage offers made by the ironlords of 
the Rhineland, but needing to replace their agricultural workers, 
they pulled Polish workers from the Vistula valley farther east. 
Win-win-win-win, no?

The Polish-speaking population remaining in the Vistula was 
happy:  they  had  larger  farms.  The  Polish-speaking  population 
who moved to Germany was happy: they had higher wages and

a better life. The German-speaking landlords were happy: they 
could sell their grain at a higher price to the booming German 
West without having to match the wages of the German West. 
The  German-speaking  workers  who  moved  west  were  happy: 
they had higher wages and a better life. The German-speaking 
ironlords and other industrialists and merchants were happy: they 
had an expanded labor force. The aristocrats who ran the German 
national state were happy: they had a stronger economy, more tax 
revenue, less poverty, and consequently a lower level of democrat-
ic-egalitarian-socialist agitation.

Who was left to be unhappy? Max Weber, and every other 

blinkered German nationalist, is who.

Note  that  Weber  was,  in  pre–World  War  I  Germany,  sol-
idly in the center-left. He was no socialist, but he was otherwise 
a friend to political democracy, to mass education, and to eco-
nomic  prosperity,  and  a  foe  to  parasitic  aristocracies  and  rigid 
social orders.

The scary thing is that German nationalism was not excep-
tional in pre–World War I Europe. Rather, if not quite the norm, 
it was close to it. Usually manifest, nationalism was understood 
as destiny in a winner-take-most (maybe all) contest in which war 
was viewed not as a catastrophe but as an opportunity: an oppor-
tunity for national assertion, national mobilization, and the cre-
ation of a stronger national identity—as well as an opportunity to 
win the spoils of war, whatever those might be.

However, suppose you refuse to fall under the spell of some 
particular nationalism. Suppose you do not buy into its encour-
agements  for  assertion,  for  mobilization,  for  identity,  and  for 
spoils. Then it becomes clear that all of the politicians and mili-
tary officers near the apex of early decision-making were at best 
badly mistaken and at worst criminally insane. For it all ended 
badly. While the kings of the monarchies joining the “winning” 
Anglo-French side retained their thrones, all of the continental

European emperors whose ministers made war would lose theirs. 
But  the  ironic  quote  marks,  “winning”:  those  belong  there. 
Nearly  ten  million  people  died  in  World  War  I.  If  we  believe 
that the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918–1919 was made an order 
of magnitude greater than it would otherwise have been by the 
travel, disruption, and famine of the war, then the death toll ap-
proaches fifty million.

Consider that the rulers of Austria-Hungary had for a long 
time been worried about Serbian nationalism, or rather, the ex-
tension of Serbian nationalism northward as ideologues argued 
that  Serbs,  Bosnians,  Croats,  Slovenes,  and  others  were  really 
one  nation—“Yugoslavs”—and  that  only  alien  rule  by  Turks 
from Istanbul and by Germans from Vienna had prevented the 
previous emergence of a glorious south-Slav nation.

Consider that less than eighty years separate the time when 
Serbs and Croats were blood brothers (so much so that the Serbs 
would risk bloody war with Europe’s great powers to rescue the 
Croats from oppressive foreign despotism) and our time (when 
Serbs  and  Croats  cannot  live  in  the  same  village  or  province 
without the political leaders of at least one side calling for the 
extermination and exile of the other). And, as happened eighty 
years earlier, what leaders called for, their followers undertook. 
To fight one set of wars at the start of the twentieth century to 
unify Serbs and Croats, and another set of wars at the end of 
that century to “ethnically cleanse” Serbs of Croats, and Cro-
ats of Serbs, seems among the sickest jokes history ever played 
on humans, or, more causally accurate, humans ever played on 
history.

A  semi-democratic,  constitutional  monarchy  like  that  of  the 
Habsburg-ruled Austro-Hungarian Empire, that while ruling over 
various nationalities respected (most) local customs, kept the peace, 
and allowed freedom of commerce, belief, and speech (within lim-
its), seems much more than halfway up the list of desirable regimes.

But not to the blood-brother forebears of their genocidal Serb and 
Croat offspring.

In the summer of 1914, a Bosnian terrorist seeking Bosnian 
independence  from  the  Austro-Hungarian  Empire  and  union 
with  Serbia  assassinated  the  heir  to  the  throne  of  the  Austro- 
Hungarian Empire, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, 
Sophie. The terrorist had received some assistance from the se-
cret  police  of  the  Kingdom  of  Serbia—although  almost  surely 
not with the active knowledge of the King of Serbia.8

For the old emperor Franz Joseph in Vienna and his advis-
ers, the outrageous murder of his nephew (and his wife) seemed 
to call for action. And it would take the form of punishing the 
guilty,  humbling  Serbia,  and  making  it  plain  that  Austria  was 
the great power in the Balkans. To establish this seemed worth 
a small risk of a large war. After all, the Balkan Wars of the early 
twentieth century, the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the Franco- 
Prussian  War  of  1870,  the  Austro-Prussian  War  of  1866,  the 
Prusso- Austro-Danish  War  of  1864,  and  the  Franco-Austrian 
War of 1859 had all been very short. The Crimean War of 1853–
1856 had been longer, but it had been a limited war: neither set 
of  combatants  had  thought  the  stakes  high  enough  to  make  it 
worthwhile to derange civilian society. And the American Civil 
War of 1861–1865, which had killed one in five and maimed 
another one in five of the white adult males in the arc of coastal 
states from Texas to Virginia—that was not seen as relevant.

It was not the only missed relevant fact.
For the not-so-old czar in St. Petersburg, Nicholas II, and his 
ministers, the most important priority was to demonstrate that 
czarist Russia was the great power in the Balkans. And this re-
quired  that  small  Slavic-speaking  nations  understand  that  they 
could count on it to protect them from Viennese hegemony.

For  the  not-so-old  German  emperor  in  Berlin,  Wilhelm 
II, and his ministers, the possibility of a quick, decisive victory 
over both France and Russia promised to secure for Germany a

dominant “place in the sun” among the great powers of Europe. 
The  decision  to  back  Austria  to  the  hilt,  in  whatever  action  it 
chose to take in response to the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, 
was  nearly  automatic.  And  how  could  it  conceivably  be  other-
wise? During the 1800s, the standing and power of the German 
Empire  had  been  radically  enhanced  by  short,  victorious  wars 
provoked and managed by the so-called Iron Chancellor, Otto 
von Bismarck, a German politician who had earned thunderous 
applause by declaring, “It is not by speeches and debates that the 
great issues of the day will be decided, but by Blood and Iron.”

For the politicians of the French Third Republic, a war with 
Germany needed to be fought someday in order to recover Al-
sace and Lorraine, which had been stolen by Germany in 1870. 
And it was, to politicians and populace alike, self-evidently worth 
killing a lot of people to make sure that the city of Strasbourg 
was not called “Strassburg,” and that its mayor spoke French, not 
German.  For  the  politicians  of  the  British  Empire  in  London, 
risks of war were worth running to show that the British Empire 
could not be pushed around. What was more, Germany before 
World War I had built a battle fleet that Britain saw as an exis-
tential threat, and Britain found itself forced to spend a fortune 
to outmatch it. Recall Winston Churchill’s joke about the pace 
of pre–World War I British dreadnought battleship construction: 
the Liberal government was willing to budget for four new battle-
ships a year, the navy admirals demanded six, and the press and 
public opinion, with their fear of imperial Germany coming to 
the fore, pushed them to compromise at eight.

All  those  who  thought  that  war  would  be  good,  even  if 
just  for  them,  were  wrong.  The  old  Emperor  Franz  Joseph’s 
Habsburg dynasty would lose its throne and his empire. To un-
certainly clarify the pronunciation of “Strasbourg,” the French 
would lose a generation of young men. The British would also 
lose a generation of young men on the way to a much weaker 
post–World War I empire, with which it would confront, again,

a German- dominated Europe. The Russian czar lost his throne, 
his life, and his country, with his entire family slaughtered as 
well. Russia, too, lost a generation of young men, as well as its 
chance to have a less-than-totally-unhappy twentieth century.

World War I did not secure for Germany a dominant “place 
in the sun” among the great powers of Europe. Wilhelm lost his 
throne.  His  country  lost  its  political  and  military  autonomy,  a 
generation of young men, and took the first steps along the road 
to Hitler’s Third Reich, a regime that would blacken the name 
of Germany for millennia. And it would take more than thirty 
years before French politicians would realize that trying to con-
tain Germany by using their army simply did not work, and that 
perhaps a better way to try to contain German power would be to 
integrate it economically into a wider Europe.

So why did they do it? First, there was nationalism. There was 
also the political logic that winning this war made it less likely 
that you would lose a future one, and therefore less likely that you 
would suffer the consequences.

But there was more. There was aristocracy. The Europe of 
1914  was  a  Europe  of  national  populations,  of  industrialists 
and socialists, of factory workers and technicians. But Europe’s 
governments in 1914—especially the defense and foreign affairs  
ministries—were largely populated by aristocrats, ex-aristocrats, 
and would-be aristocrats. This meant that the aristocratic, land-
lord,  military  elites  had  control  of  many  of  the  levers  of  pro-
paganda  and  power.  Moreover,  the  aristocrats  had  help  from 
industrialists  and  entrepreneurs  who  were  eager  to  secure  eco-
nomic benefits, as happened with the 1879 German “marriage 
of iron and rye”: the imposition of tariffs on imports of British 
steel (to protect the positions of German manufacturers) and on 
imports of American grain (to protect the positions of German 
landlords).9

On the eve of World War I, these elites increasingly found 
themselves members of a social caste with no societal function.

They could look forward only to the erosion of their influence 
and status, the erosion of their relative wealth, and the erosion of 
their self-respect. In the world of win-win-win economics, these 
aristocrats and wannabe aristocrats, in all their thousands, would 
inevitably lose. Or, to avoid that fate, they could lead their na-
tions into war.

Power and propaganda were reinforced by ideology. Each na-
tion decided that it had a strong interest in ensuring that its people 
left the most enduring imprint on all future civilizations. Enlight-
enment  and  Christian  values  of  peace,  fraternity,  and  charity, 
mean while, fell out of favor.

The aristocrats of Europe were at most half-conscious of how 
much they had to lose when they rolled the dice in 1914. But roll 
the dice they did. They rallied mass support by creating a power-
ful echo chamber, in which propaganda and ideology reinforced 
each other. And the civilized masses of the West, more learned 
and better fed and clothed and housed than any previous genera-
tion, rallied behind them enthusiastically.

Causation and metaphors matter. That the nations of Europe 
fell like dominoes is one sort of explanation, encouraging one set 
of understandings. Because a butterfly beat its wings, a tornado 
touched down a continent away. Because the zeitgeist, the dia-
lectic unfolding of History, the finger of Providence—take your 
pick—set one domino in motion, the rest fell.

The archduke had been killed. Serbia had rejected Austria’s 
ultimatum. Austria had declared war on Serbia. Germany sought 
to convince Austria that, to demonstrate it was serious, it should 
attack, but then “halt in Belgrade” and negotiate. Russia began to 
mobilize. At that point Germany attacked Belgium. It was Au-
gust 4, 1914. It was that stupid.

The laughter of the guns began as Germany’s heavy artillery 
began  destroying  Belgian  forts  and  killing  Belgian  soldiers  and 
civilians. Begin a war with a surprise attack on an uninvolved, 
neutral power, in a way that may well add the world’s preeminent

superpower to your enemies when you are already outproduced, 
outgunned, and outnumbered. Why would it make sense for a 
military bureaucracy to do such a thing?

I have long thought that a large component of the answer was 
“Prussia.”10 The German Empire on the eve of World War I was 
dominated by its component Kingdom of Prussia. And Prussia 
was dominated by its army—it was not so much a state with an 
army, as an army with a state, was the French witticism for centu-
ries. Prussia’s army had a dominant military tradition of attacking 
first, by surprise, from an unexpected direction. Why? Because it 
was in a region without natural defenses and surrounded by more 
populous and often richer potential adversaries. Any state in such 
a situation was very likely to lose any war it did not quickly win. 
So if there was going to be a strong state in the region, it would 
have to be one that did win wars quickly—hence the Prussian 
way of war. And Prussia then, by historical accident upon acci-
dent, became the nucleus around which the circa-1900 German 
imperial nation was formed.

Indeed, it almost worked. Had Britain stayed out of the war, 
the odds are that the Germans would have conquered Paris in 
August 1914, after which a peace of the diplomats could have 
been within immediate reach. But Britain entered the war, first 
for the sake of its treaty commitment to Belgium, but probably 
more important to prevent the creation of a hegemonic Germany 
on the European continent that could then easily afford to build 
a battle fleet that would leave Britain with no strategic options.11
And so the trigger was pulled. The war would be fought by 
the  mass-conscripted  eighteen-  to  twenty-one-year-old  boys  of 
Europe, augmented by older reserves who had received their mil-
itary training in the previous decades. These armies marched off 
enthusiastically, singing and taking the causes of the emperors, 
aristocrats, and generals for their own, and all sides expected a 
short, victorious war.

World War I

World War I would have been bad, but not an utterly and 
unutterably intolerable catastrophic disaster if it had been a short 
war.  But  the  initial  combatants  were  so  evenly  matched  at  the 
start that there would be no quick victory or short war. It was a 
long war. British assistance to France kept it from being overrun 
in the fall of 1914. German assistance on the eastern front kept 
Austria from being overrun in the fall of 1914. And then they 
all dug trenches. Ultimately, it became a total war, a resource- 
mobilization-based war of attrition that dragged on for more than 
four years.

Generals  called  for  greater  and  greater  commitments  of  re-
sources  to  the  front:  if  battles  could  not  be  won  by  strategy, 
perhaps they could be won by the sheer weight of men, metal, 
and explosives. In Britain—which attained the highest degree of  
mobilization—the government was sucking up more than one-
third of national product (plus the time of conscripted soldiers) 
for the war effort by 1916.

Mobilizing economic resources for total war was not some-
thing anybody had planned for. Military plans had all assumed 
a short war, one that would be decisively won or lost in a matter 
of months, in a single battle or two. When reality set in, govern-
ments and armies turned to frantic expedients to resupply their 
troops and ramp up war production. Production became dictated 
by the representatives of industry’s largest customer, the military, 
rather than by market forces. Yet the army could not simply pay 
through the nose what the industrialists wanted to charge. And so 
the market needed to be substantially replaced by rationing and 
command-and-control.12

Was  that  possible?  Yes.  In  all  cases,  those  who  ran  the  in-
dustrial materials-allocation directorates succeeded. Such success 
turned  out  to  be  surprisingly  easy,  even  though  running  them 
efficiently  would  have  been  surprisingly  difﬁcult.  Nevertheless, 
the example of the German war economy made some, such as

Vladimir Lenin, believe that a “command economy” was possi-
ble. You could run a socialist economy not through the market 
but by using the government as a command-and-control bureau-
cracy—and not just during national emergency, but as a matter 
of course. The evidence was there in the example of a war that 
made total mobilization necessary.

There were other, better lessons to be learned: for example, 
the  importance  of  the  military  research  laboratory,  combined 
with a bureaucracy that could exploit it at scale. As the United 
States was to prove throughout the twentieth century, the win-
ners of wars tended to be those with the biggest factories.

Once German dreams of a swift victory were dashed, and ev-
eryone went to their trenches, the logic of the Prussian way of 
war—if you fail to win quickly, sue for peace—fell out of favor. 
The German officer corps’ adherence to Totenritt—a willingness 
to  undertake  a  “death  ride”—held  sway,  so  that  carrying  out 
senseless orders to the best of one’s ability substituted for logic.

But even then, hunkering down would have been to no avail 
without the genius of German scientists and administrators. The 
scientists  were  men  such  as  Fritz  Haber,  winner  of  the  Nobel 
Prize in 1918 for his creation of the power to extract useful nitro-
gen compounds literally out of thin air. (Carl Bosch, who man-
aged the operation to scale up Haber’s process to industrial size, 
received his prize in 1931.) This discovery was an enormous boon 
to those who needed fertilizers to grow crops. It was also essential 
to Germany’s ability to fight anything other than a very short war: 
without nitrogen pulled from the air by the Haber-Bosch pro-
cess, Germany would have run out of explosives and ammunition 
within six months, and nearly ten million people would not have 
died. On the one hand, Haber-Bosch prevented mass starvation: 
factory production of fertilizers on a large scale would have been 
impossible had it required finding and exploiting the very limited 
natural deposits of ammonia available. On the other hand, Fritz 
Haber is sometimes called the father of chemical weapons. He

traveled from his laboratory to the trench line of the western front 
to watch his chlorine gas deployed for the first time at the Second 
Battle of Ypres in 1915.

A German Jew, Haber fled Germany when Adolf Hitler took 

power in 1933. He died in January 1934 in Basel, Switzerland.

The  administrators  were  people  such  as  Walther  Rathenau,  
who  established  the  industrial-materials  priority  command- and-   
control system that Germany used to keep its value chains func-
tioning, at least for the production of war materiel, after the British 
naval blockade had cut off international trade. “I am a German 
of Jewish origin. My people are the German people, my home is  
Germany, my faith is German faith, which stands above all de-
nominations,” wrote Rathenau.13

He was assassinated by right-wing antisemitic German terror-

ists in 1922.

Another lesson comes courtesy of the German Socialist Party 
(SPD). Founded in 1875, and promptly outlawed by Bismarck, 
by 1914 it had a million dues-paying members. The SPD was the 
largest political party in the world and held 34 percent of the seats 
in the German Reichstag. It had been founded to bring about 
the overthrow of capitalism and oversee the rise of a just socialist 
society. Whether that would be created by revolution, evolve nat-
urally as the contradictions of capitalism manifested themselves, 
or evolve and then have to be defended in the streets against a 
reactionary coup was left ambiguous. The SPD, indeed, had been 
founded  to  advance  the  international  brotherhood  of  workers, 
and with that in mind, had promised to oppose militarism in all 
of its forms.

So  what  did  the  SPD  do  when  the  Emperor  Wilhelm  II’s 
ministers  asked  for  money  to  fight  World  War  I?  When  the 
SPD’s  caucus  met  on  August  3,  1914,  cochair  Hugo  Haase, 
leader of the pacifist faction, was incredulous. “You want to ap-
prove war credits for the Germany of the Hohenzollern [Em-
peror] and the Prussian [landlord-aristocrat-officer-bureaucrat]

Junkers?” Haase asked. “No,” said his fellow cochair, Friedrich 
Ebert.  “Not  for  that  Germany,  but  for  the  Germany  of  pro-
ductive labor, the Germany of the social and cultural ascent of 
the masses. It is a matter of saving that Germany! We cannot 
abandon  the  fatherland  in  its  moment  of  need.  It  is  a  matter 
of protecting women and children.” Only 13 of the 110 SPD  
Reichstag deputies joined Haase’s position in the internal caucus 
vote to determine the party line.14

What  were  they  protecting  women  and  children  from?  In 
August it was clear. They were protecting them from the czar-
ist tyranny that would follow a Russian victory in the war that 
Germany had started by attacking Belgium. The efficiency of the 
innovative industrial-research lab paired to modern corporations 
grasping for economies of scale and to well-ordered administra-
tion was immense. But that could be thrown away when princi-
ples and ideals told you that survival, or at least identity, was at 
risk. Economic growth is a measurable metric. Nationalism, not 
so much. Confronted by the powers of nationalist wars of choice, 
ideals such as utopia and principles of market-over-man, or vice 
versa, bend if they do not break. Yet, do the nationalist replace-
ments truly have efficacy, utility, or value?

It would have been much better for the German people had 
the SPD stuck to its prewar pacifist guns and then been success-
ful  in  hobbling  the  imperial  German  war  effort,  leading  to  an 
early  peace.  For  Germany  lost.  In  the  end,  the  weight  of  men 
and metal arranged against Germany and its allies did tell. It was 
France, Belgium, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy (from 1915), 
Romania, and the United States (from 1917) against the Austro- 
Hungarian, German, and Ottoman Empires and Bulgaria, and at 
the end of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Empire’s army collapsed. 
The  generals  announced  that  the  German  army  in  France  was 
facing defeat. With foodstuffs stopped by British blockade, the 
German population at home was over the edge of starvation. And 
Germany sought an armistice.

If you want to know more about what happened during the 
war—about  the  battles  and  leaders  and  campaigns  and  casu-
alties—you’d  do  well  to  read  another  book.15  I  don’t  have  the 
heart to write it down. There were ten million dead, ten million 
maimed, and ten million lightly injured out of a population of 
some one hundred million adult men from the major belliger-
ents. The overwhelming share of war casualties were soldiers, not 
civilians. A full year’s worth of the full production powers of every 
belligerent power was wasted. The imperial-authoritarian politi-
cal orders in the Russian, Turkish, Austrian, and German Em-
pires had collapsed. The political order in Italy was at the point of 
collapse. Confidence that the world was run by farsighted states-
men in a way that supported progress was gone.

From 1870 to 1914, we can see global economic history as 
following  a  logic  that  was,  if  not  inevitable,  at  least  probable, 
or  at  least  explicable  after  the  fact.  Luck  and  probability  gave 
humanity an opening around 1870 in the form of a quintuple 
breakthrough:  the  ideology  and  policy  of  an  open  world,  new 
forms of transportation, faster communications, and—most im-
portant—the beginnings of the research laboratory and the large 
corporation, which together would more than double the pace 
of invention and greatly speed the deployment of new technol-
ogies.  From  1870  to  1914,  the  economic  logic  rolled  forward: 
inventors  became  more  specialized  and  prolific,  corporations  
deployed more technology. An international division of labor de-
veloped, and global growth continued apace, while also spurring 
the creation of a low-wage periphery, as well as the concentration 
of industrialization and wealth in what is still the global north. 
Humanity, meanwhile, began to escape from the Malthusian di-
lemma, as the tendency for technological progress gained ground 
on  ever-greater  population  numbers,  and  work  shifted  increas-
ingly from farm to factory. All in all, the period saw the coming 
of sufficient (if ill-distributed) prosperity—and with it, the pos-
sibility  that  someday,  not  that  far  away,  humanity,  in  the  rich

economies of the global north, at least, might attain something 
that previous eras would have judged to be a genuine utopia.

From 1870 to 1914 we can see global political-economic his-
tory as by and large following a possible, if not an overwhelm-
ingly likely or near-necessary, path. We see the threading of the 
needle in the creation and maintenance of an increasingly liberal 
order within the economies and polities of the global north. We 
see expanding suffrage, growing rights, increasing prosperity, in-
creasing inequality (accompanied by political movements to curb 
such inequalities), and an absence of large-scale revolution. We 
see the conquest of the rest of the world into formal and informal 
empires as the difference in power between the North Atlantic 
and the rest became overwhelmingly huge.

All of this could have been otherwise. But that events from 
1870 to 1914 followed the course that they did is not surprising 
given where the world was in 1870.

This  sense  of  history  having  a  broad  and  nearly  irresistible 
structural logic vanishes with World War I. It did not have to 
happen—the 1914 Bosnian crisis might have been finessed, or 
the war might have ended with a quick, decisive victory for one 
side or the other, or governments and elites might have come to 
their senses. Was some such catastrophe like World War I proba-
ble? Was humanity just unlucky?

History did not, after 1918, return to its structural pattern of 
broad forces and tides in which individual quirks and choices av-
eraged out. History was still one damned thing after another. In-
dividuals’ visions, choices, and actions continued to matter. And 
not just the individuals who became dictators of great powers.

John Maynard Keynes saw the war as a previously unimag-
inable horror. He saw his own participation in its planning, from 
his  desk  at  the  British  Treasury,  as  contemptible.  Keynes,  ret-
rospectively, scorned the naïveté of the upper-middle-class pre–
World War I inhabitants of London “for whom life offered, at a 
low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences, comforts, and

amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful 
monarchs of other ages.” These Londoners had seen “this state 
of affairs,” he said, “as normal, certain, and permanent, except in 
the direction of further improvement,” and they had seen “any 
deviation from it . . . as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.”

He was, of course, speaking of himself. He and his had seen 
“the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism, of ra-
cial and cultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and exclu-
sion, which were to play the serpent to this paradise,” as “little 
more than the amusements of [the] daily newspaper.” And “they 
appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary 
course of economic and social life.”16

They had been wrong, with awful consequences for the world. 
Keynes saw that he was one of the ones who had been so blind 
and so wrong. And so, for the rest of his life, he took on respon-
sibility. Responsibility for what? For—don’t laugh—saving the 
world.  The  curious  thing  is  the  extent  to  which  he  succeeded, 
especially for someone who was only a pitiful, isolated individual, 
and who never held any high political office.17

Roaring Twenties

W as the interruption of the patterns of 1870–1914 occa-

sioned by World War I permanent? Or was there a fork 
in humanity’s possible road after the guns stopped their laughter 
on November 11, 1918? Could history have treated World War 
I almost as if it had just been a bad dream? Could humanity have 
pursued a win-win logic of progress and prosperity after World 
War I, as it had broadly been doing before it—with large groups 
of  people,  acting  both  individually  and  collectively,  trading, 
forming alliances, and making positive-sum decisions about how 
to rebuild, reform, and regulate their economies?

The  pre–World  War  I  pattern  could  not  be  restored  com-
pletely, of course. Emperors were gone, much had been broken, 
and many were dead. But couldn’t humanity in some sense wind 
back the clock four and a half years, adjust things, and fix the 
flaws, so that the demons of militarism, imperialism, anarchism, 
and nationalism would not push the world forward into a similar 
immediate and dire catastrophe, and resume its march, or slouch, 
toward utopia?

The period from 1870 to 1914 had indeed been economic El 
Dorado, reaching both a level and a rate of growth of world pros-
perity previously unseen. The proportional advance in technolo-
gies for manipulating nature and organizing humanity deployed

into the world economy had proportionally been roughly as great 
a  leap  forward  as  the  combined  progress  over  the  period  from 
1500 to 1870. And that was as great a leap, in turn, as all the 
advances in technology from 1200 BCE to 1500 CE, from the era 
of the biblical Exodus and the Trojan War and the end of the 
Bronze Age to the beginning of the Imperial-Commercial Age.

In 1914, things had never before been so good. And it was 
not just the power to produce. The world in the first half of that 
year was much kinder and gentler than in previous ages: propor-
tionately, there were many fewer slaves, and many more votes. 
Surely full consensus in favor of a rewind, and then a do-over, 
with the militarist-nationalists cowed by the memory of the abat-
toir of 1914–1918, was a complete no-brainer?

The political task of keeping the general peace, and of restor-
ing  the  international  division  of  labor,  even  deepening  it,  and 
deploying productive technologies ought, in some sense, to have 
been easy—in the wake of World War I, surely not even those 
of dubious sanity would want to do that again. Nationalism had 
proven  a  disaster.  Surely  its  opposite,  cosmopolitanism,  a  rec-
ognition that the nations shared a “common home” and should 
treat each other as housemates treat each other, was the obvious 
alternative?1

Plus, there was great opportunity: one-third of the belliger-
ents’  production—two-ninths  of  world  production—no  longer 
needed  to  be  devoted  to  killing  people,  maiming  people,  and 
blowing things up. It could be turned instead to accomplish all 
kinds of wonderful things. The world, after all, had roughly three 
times the technological capability in the 1920s than it had had 
back in 1870. Even with a population half again as large as it had 
been in 1870, and even with a rising concentration of wealth at 
the between-country and within-country levels, that meant that 
the bulk of humanity had something their predecessors had never 
had: confidence that next year food, clothing, and shelter would 
be  there,  so  that  their  families  would  not  be  overwhelmingly

hungry, cold, and wet. The system that people were to look back 
on and call “classical liberalism,” although it was so recent as to 
be only pseudo-classical, and so built on authority inherited and 
ascribed to be only semi-liberal, had been a good one, the best 
one the world had hitherto seen.

So wasn’t the process and system that had led the world to a 
better place in terms of potential material productivity in 1920 
relative to 1870 worth restoring and continuing, in spite of its 
many and grievous flaws? Or, if it needed to be altered, surely 
people of goodwill could have reached rough consensus as to how.
Two  currents  of  thought  emerged  after  World  War  I  that 
sought not just alteration but fundamental transformation of the 
pseudo-classical semi-liberal order. They were to gain flesh and 
rule, bloodily and destructively. They were Vladimir Lenin’s ver-
sion of really-existing socialism, and Benito Mussolini’s fascism, 
both of which you will see later at great length.

But there were others thinking hard and trying to work to 
find and implement a better system. If I may digress for a mo-
ment: If my editor would allow this book to be twice as long, I 
would trace many of these currents of thought and the actions 
that  flowed  from  them.  I  would  trace  the  current  for  which  
Joseph Schumpeter, born in 1882 one hundred miles away from 
Vienna  in  the  primarily  Czech-speaking  part  of  the  Austro- 
Hungarian Empire, is a convenient marker: society needing to be 
altered to elevate the role of the entrepreneur and provide space 
for the “creative destruction” of economic and other patterns of 
organization he set in motion to counterbalance growing bureau-
cratization brought about by the increasing scale of capital inten-
sity needed to deploy technological advances.2 I would trace the 
current for which Karl Popper, born in Vienna in 1902, is a con-
venient  marker:  society  needing  to  double  down  on  liberalism 
and freedom in all their forms to create a truly “open society.”3 I 
would trace the current for which Peter Drucker, born in Vienna 
in 1909, is a convenient marker: how freedom, entrepreneurship,

cooperation, and organization could never be reconciled by ei-
ther the laissez-faire market or the really-existing socialist plan, 
but  instead  required  persuasion,  in  the  form  of  managers  and 
management, to reconcile points of view and actually get humans 
to, you know, work cooperatively semi-efficiently.4

Moreover,  I  would  trace  the  current  for  which  Michael  
Po lanyi,  born  in  1891  in  Budapest,  is  a  convenient  marker:  
society needing not just the decentralized mercenary institution 
of the market, and definitely not needing comprehensive central 
planning,  which  can  never  be  more  than  a  fiction,  but  need-
ing  decentralized  fiduciary  institutions  focused  on  advancing 
knowledge about theory and practice, in which status is gained 
by  teaching  others—such  as  in  modern  science,  communities 
of  engineering  practice,  communities  of  legal  interpretation, 
honorable journalism, evidence-based politics, and others—and 
in  which  people  follow  rules  that  have  been  half-constructed  
and that half-emerged to advance not just the private interests 
and liberties of the participants but the broader public interest 
and public liberties as well.5

But as there is neither time nor space for all of that, in this 
book I can only trace two currents of thought and action: first, the 
current we have seen before, for which Friedrich von Hayek (born 
in Vienna in 1899) is a convenient marker (that all that needed to 
be altered was that market-economic institutions had to be pur-
ified  and  perfected,  and  supported  by  an  anti-permissive  social 
and cultural order) and the current we have seen before for which 
Michael Polanyi’s older brother Karl, born in Vienna in 1886, is 
the convenient marker (that the market recognized only property 
rights, and a society made up of humans who insisted that they 
had more rights for that would react—left or right, sensibly or 
stupidly, but powerfully—to that failure of recognition). And I 
will trace how they could be shotgun-married to each other, with 
the blesser of the wedding being John Maynard Keynes. That, I 
believe, is the principal grand narrative, or at least it is mine.

Could the clock have been turned back to 1914, and then set 
to ticking again as if World War I had just been a bad dream? 
Was  the  restoration  of  the  pseudo-classical  semi-liberal  order, 
and a post-1918 that went again like 1870–1914, a road human-
ity could have taken in 1919, had just a few key decisions gone 
differently?

Whether or not there was a fork, and a better path that realis-
tically could have been taken, the history of the post–World War 
I era tells us that it was not taken at all.

One big reason was that after 1918 the world lacked a single 
power to serve as what the economic historian (and my teacher) 
Charlie Kindleberger called the hegemon. General prosperity, sta-
ble financial calm, and rapid and balanced growth are what econo-
mists call public goods—everyone benefits from them with no one 
having to take individual steps to provide them. A large majority 
of countries tend to believe that some other country (or countries) 
will take care of the system as a whole. This belief allows them to 
concentrate on achieving their own national advantage. The state 
whose citizens play the largest role in the world economy—who 
ship the most exports, consume the most imports, and lend and 
borrow the most capital—winds up playing the leading role in 
the management of the international economy. It becomes the 
hegemon, often at its own citizens’ encouragement. After all, its 
citizens have the most at stake in the successful management of 
the global economy. The other state “free-ride” on the hegemon. 
The world economy always needs a hegemon. In 1919, however, 
the United States, the world’s new potential hegemon, demurred. 
Before 1914, Britain could play this role, and it did. After 1919, 
“the  British  couldn’t  and  the  United  States  wouldn’t,”  wrote 
Kindleberger. “When every country turned to protect its national 
private interest, the world public interest went down the drain, 
and with it the private interests of all.”6

World  War  I  had  not  left  the  United  States  unscarred—it 
suffered  300,000  casualties,  of  which  110,000  were  deaths,  of

which  half  were  from  combat  (the  other  half  were  from  the 
Spanish flu). But World War I had not been to Americans the 
civilization- disrupting shock it was to Europeans. In the United 
States, what people afterward were to call the Belle Époque did 
not end in 1914 but continued in various forms—the Prohibi-
tion experiment, the Jazz Age, and Florida land speculation; the 
build-out of mass production factories; new high-tech industrial 
sectors such as radio; and stock market castles in the air built on 
hopes of rapid technological revolution. In other words, human-
ity’s  utopian  aspirations  were  made  flesh—or  rather,  steel—in 
the 1920s United States. So, having been among the world’s free- 
riders,  the  United  States  shied  away  from  becoming  the  hege-
mon. Instead, it turned inward.

Rather than take up the role of world leader, its people and 
politicians  opted  for  isolationism.  Though  President  Wood-
row  Wilson  was  in  a  uniquely  strong  position  at  the  end  of 
hostilities—  he had moral authority as the only belligerent not 
to  have  entered  the  war  for  territorial  or  political  advantage, 
and he had the only effective army—he made next to nothing 
of  the  opportunity.  Instead,  he  accepted  the  lead  of  Britain’s 
David Lloyd George and France’s Georges Clemenceau to a de-
gree that outran even Lloyd George’s calculations, and fright-
ened him. Wilson did try to get one thing out of the Treaty of 
Versailles:  the  League  of  Nations,  a  forum  in  which  interna-
tional  agreements  could  be  reached,  and  in  which  arguments 
for  revisions  and  readjustments  to  those  agreements  could  be 
made. But Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts and 
his Republican peers, who ruled America in the 1920s, refused 
to even think about committing the country in any way to an 
internationalist foreign policy. The League would come into be-
ing without the United States as a member.7

In  addition  to  refusing  to  join  an  international  body  that 
existed for the purpose of encouraging communication among 
countries, the United States in the aftermath of World War I

added  new  restrictions  on  the  flow  of  immigrants  and  raised 
tariffs.  The  increases  were  nowhere  near  the  avowedly  protec-
tionist  levels  of  the  early  1800s,  or  even  the  revenue-raising- 
cum- protectionist levels of the late nineteenth century. But they 
were large enough to give pause to producers outside the United 
States who doubted if they could rely on uninterrupted access to 
the US market. There was no return to normalcy. There was no 
lifting the locomotives of economic growth, prosperity, and hu-
man flourishing back onto their pre–World War I tracks. While 
structural  factors  and  underlying  trends  made  their  influence 
felt, they did so very much not for the better.

At the same time, the globalization fairy had turned evil, and 

brought a poisoned gift.

Humanity should have been expecting it. In May 1889, peo-
ple had begun dying of influenza—the Asiatic flu—in Bokhara, 
Uzbekistan. There was then a trans-Caspian railway, and so the 
disease spread to the Caspian Sea, and then via the Russian Em-
pire’s  river  and  rail  network  to  Moscow,  Kiev,  and  St.  Peters-
burg, all by November. Half the population of Stockholm caught 
the flu by the end of the year. In the United States the Evening 
World newspaper in New York reported, “It is not deadly, not 
even necessarily dangerous, but it will afford a grand opportunity 
for the dealers to work off their surplus of bandanas.” Deaths in 
the United States peaked in January 1890.

Globalization  would  continue  to  bring  plagues,  and  the 
plagues spread rapidly throughout the world. More than 1 mil-
lion people each were killed by the Asian flu of 1957–1958 and 
the Hong Kong flu of 1968–1970. The COVID-19 pandemic 
that began in 2020 has so far killed an estimated 4.5 million, as 
of this writing, and the slow-moving plague of HIV/AIDS has to 
date killed around 35 million. But by far the most deadly plague 
in modern history remains the Spanish flu of 1918–1920, which 
killed perhaps 50 million people out of a world population then 
approaching 1.9 billion—about 2.5 percent.8

It was not, actually, a Spanish flu. Wartime censorship among 
the Allied powers suppressed flu news out of a fear that it would 
be bad for morale, so the newspapers focused on the flu in neutral 
countries where they had correspondents, which meant, mostly, 
Spain, where patients included King Alfonso XIII. The greatest 
boost to the flu’s spread may well have come from the French 
base and hospital of Étaples, through which tens of thousands of 
soldiers passed each day. It killed not just the young and the old 
but also the middle-aged and the healthy. Nearly half of those 
who died were adults between the ages of twenty and forty. The 
Lord branch of my ancestral family tree fled Boston and went to 
rural Maine. Many of their cousins who remained in Boston did 
not survive.

As the plague raged, European governments tried frantically 
to start winding back the clock to the spring of 1914. But they 
could not. The first reason they could not was that, while there 
might have been consensus that World War I should not have 
been, there was no consensus about how all the losing empires 
were to be governed. The post–World War I settlement would 
give a mandate to the victorious allies Britain and France to take 
over and rule former German colonies and former non-Turkish 
Ottoman dependencies—but Turkey itself, and the territories of 
the  former  Russian,  Austro-Hungarian,  and  German  Empires, 
were left to their own devices, which meant “voting” with some 
combination  of  weapons  and  ballots  how  they  should  be  gov-
erned. For after World War I all the emperors (with the exception 
of the British king, George V Windsor, in his persona as Kaiser-i-        
Hind, Emperor of India) were gone. And with them went their 
camarillas and their dependent aristocrats.

The Russian czar, Nicholas II Romanov, abdicated in March 
1917.  Vladimir  I.  Lenin  and  his  Bolsheviks  shot  him  and  his 
family— Nicholas,  Alexandra,  and  their  five  children—along 
with  family  retainers,  in  mid-1918.  The  semi-socialist  govern-
ment of Aleksandr Kerensky that followed organized an election

for a Constituent Assembly to write a constitution. Lenin sent 
the assembly home at bayonet point. With no claim to legitimacy 
by election, Lenin and his faction then had to confront the oth-
ers within the country who also hoped to base their rule on the 
barrels of guns. The Russian Civil War ran from 1917 to 1920.9
The German Kaiser, Wilhelm II Hohenzollern, abdicated in 
November 1918. The Social Democratic Party leader Friedrich 
Ebert became provisional president of a democratic republic. He 
did so with the support of the German army high command be-
cause he agreed to suppress revolutionaries who wanted to expro-
priate  and  nationalize  property  and  redistribute  wealth.  When 
the German socialist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxem-
burg called for not just a political but a socialist revolution, their 
Spartacus League demonstrations were quickly suppressed by sol-
diers and ex-soldiers. Luxemburg and Liebknecht were summar-
ily shot and dumped into a canal—without even the pretense that 
they were trying to escape. The left wing of the Socialist Party of 
Germany split off, never forgave, and never forgot. From then 
on,  their  principal  adversary  was  not  the  monarchists,  not  the 
plutocrats, not the center-right, not the fascists, but rather Ebert’s 
party, the Social Democrats.

The Austro-Hungarian emperor, Karl I von Habsburg, like-
wise abdicated in November 1918. His regime was carved into 
individual  nation-states  very,  very  roughly  following  extremely 
blurry ethnolinguistic borders.

The last to fall was Mehmed VI Vahideddin (Revelation of 
Faith),  sultan,  successor  of  Muhammed,  Commander  of  the 
Faithful, Caesar of Rome, and Custodian of the Two Holy Places, 
the last wielder of the sword of imperial dynasty founder Osman 
(1299–1324). Power in Turkey was taken up by Mustafa Kemal 
Atatürk in the spring of 1920.

But  even  among  the  victorious  and  politically  stable  Allied 
powers, simple winding-back did not work. The politicians did not 
want to be voted out of office as incompetents who had led their

peoples into a pointless, destructive bloodbath. So they fell over 
themselves to tell their people that they had “won” World War I, 
and that their triumph meant they were now free to harvest the 
fruits of victory.

For  the  citizens  of  the  Allied  nations—those  who  sur-
vived—the  prospect  of  extracting  resources  from  the  defeated 
Central  Powers  promised  to  make  life  even  better  than  it  had 
been before the war—to make the war and its sacrifices some-
how worthwhile. President Woodrow Wilson, however, struck 
a  very  different  tone,  announcing  that  the  peace  would  be  “a 
peace without victory,” a peace that would have to be “accepted 
in humiliation, under duress.” Claims of victory, he continued, 
“would  leave . . . a  bitter  memory  upon  which  terms  of  peace 
would rest, not permanently but only as upon quicksand.” Wil-
son added, “Only a peace between equals can last.”10 But he let 
himself be ignored—“bamboozled” was John Maynard Keynes’s 
word for it—as he was outmaneuvered by the French and British 
premiers,  Clemenceau  and  Lloyd  George.11  They  did  not  seek 
“indemnities.”  They  merely  demanded  that  Germany  “repair” 
the damage done. But how was Germany to do this? It might be 
asked to ship goods to Britain and France. But the goods that 
Germany  could  ship  would  substitute  for  the  heavy  industrial 
productions of Britain and France. Britain and France did not 
want them. Accepting them would cause mass unemployment, 
and so was a non-starter.

There was a third reason that post–World War I Europe did 
not draw away from nationalism but instead doubled down on it. 
Woodrow Wilson had proclaimed that postwar borders should be 
drawn “along historically established lines of allegiance and na-
tionality,” in order to enable the autonomous development of the 
resulting nations. The problem was that peoples were not divided 
along such lines. Every European state was left with a discontented 
minority. Many states’ dominant ethnicities had previously been

discontented minorities. They now saw themselves as having the 
power and the right to do as they had been done by.

Had the politicians of the Allied nations been wise and far-
sighted, they would have sought to lower expectations at home. 
They would have sought to draw a firm line between the war-
mongers in the defeated Central Powers—the emperors and the 
army officers and the warrior-aristocrats who were now gone—
and the people of the Central Powers. Those who had started the 
war had been, as John Maynard Keynes put it, “moved by insane 
delusion  and  reckless  self-regard”  when  they  set  things  in  mo-
tion that “overturned the foundations on which we all lived and 
built.” And with their defeat, oppressed peoples could now join 
the Allies and build their own democracies.12

Keynes’s characterization of the “insane delusion” comes from 
the very first paragraph of his 1919 book Economic Consequences of 
the Peace. But he was not describing militarists, warrior- aristocrats, 
or emperors; he was referring to “the German people.” Such was 
the  attitude  of  even  those  sympathetic  to  the  Germans  among  
the Allies.

Though Keynes blamed “the German people” for the war and 
for all the destruction and death it brought, he believed that it 
was nevertheless essential for the Allies to immediately forget all 
of that. They must, he wrote at the end of the very same para-
graph, let bygones be bygones. For if the spokesmen for the Allied 
powers sought to make Germany pay for any component of war 
damage and tried to keep Germany poor, “the spokesmen of the 
French and British peoples [would] run the risk of completing 
the ruin,” he said, through a peace that would “impair yet further, 
when it might have restored, the delicate, complicated organiza-
tion, already shaken and broken by war, through which alone the 
European peoples can employ themselves and live”13

In this Keynes sharply diverged from both popular opinion 
and the overwhelming consensus of elites among the victorious

Allied  powers.  He  had  been  among  the  staff  advising  leaders 
at  the  Paris  Peace  Conference  in  Versailles  and  had  watched 
in  horror  as  it  became  clear  that  the  object  was  to  extract  as 
much from Germany as possible. In his mind, this was likely to  
throw the whole project of post–World War I reconstruction 
off the rails.

South African prime minister Jan Christian Smuts was at the 
Versailles conference too, as leader of one of the dominions of the 
British Empire. He wrote a letter to his friend M. C. Gillet about 
what the conference was like:

Poor  Keynes  often  sits  with  me  at  night  after  a  good  din-
ner and we rail against the world and the coming flood. And 
I  tell  him  this  is  the  time  for  the  Griqua  prayer  (the  Lord 
to come himself and not send his Son, as this is not a time 
for children). And then we laugh, and behind the laughter is 
Hoover’s terrible picture of 30 million people who must die 
unless  there  is  some  great  intervention.  But  then  again  we 
think things are never really as bad as that; and something will 
turn up, and the worst will never be. And somehow all these 
phases of feeling are true and right in some sense. And in it 
all I do miss you, miss you greatly. How you and Arthur and 
I would talk things over if we were together.14

Herbert Hoover, again? Yes. When World War I broke out, 
he soon became aware that famine threatened Belgium. Britain 
was blockading Germany, and not allowing food imports. The 
Germans had conquered Belgium and wrecked a good deal of it 
on their march through. The Germans, short of food themselves 
because of the blockade, put feeding Belgium at the bottom of 
their priorities. Somehow Hoover convinced the British that if 
they let him send grain ships to Belgium, it would strengthen Bel-
gian attachment to the Allies without feeding the German army.

And somehow Hoover also convinced the Germans that if they 
allowed the grain ships into Belgium, Germany could stop send-
ing any grain to Belgium and so feed its army, and this would 
mollify Belgians by making the consequences of German occupa-
tion less dire. Hoover was very persuasive.

After  the  war  was  over,  Hoover  continued  in  the  famine- 
fighting business. He continued in his new career—that of “the 
Great Humanitarian.”15 And he did warn of 30 million famine 
deaths in the war’s aftermath if nothing was done in the way of 
relief, and he did move heaven and earth to raise money for and 
ship food to Europe, from Russia to France.

Hoover’s  solution  was  to  ship  foodstuffs.  Keynes’s  attempt 
was to take up the pen to try to change minds. When Keynes 
returned  to  England,  he  exploded  with  the  publication  of  The 
Economic Consequences of the Peace, in which he excoriated short-
sighted politicians who were, he felt, more interested in victory 
than in peace. He outlined alternative proposals. And he proph-
esied  doom:  “If  we  aim  deliberately  at  the  impoverishment  of 
Central Europe, vengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Noth-
ing can then delay for long that final civil war between the forces 
of reaction and the despairing convulsions of revolution, before 
which the horrors of the late German war will fade into nothing, 
and  which  will  destroy . . . the  civilization  and  progress  of  our 
generation.”16

If anything, he undersold what was to come.
The  postwar  trouble  started  with  inflation.  Market  econo-
mies run off of the signals that prices give to economic decision 
makers about what it would be profitable to do, and if the prices 
are right, then what is profitable is also what advances societal 
well-being. But if decision makers do not understand what prices 
are, or if prices are systematically wrong, then accurate economic 
calculation becomes very difficult and growth suffers. We are not, 
here, talking about inflation as an upward creep of prices—1 or

2 or 5 percent per year, on average. That does not cause much 
trouble or confusion. But 10, 20, or 100 percent or more? Keynes 
commented on this very question in 1924:

Lenin  is  said  to  have  declared  that  the  best  way  to  destroy 
the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a con-
tinuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, se-
cretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth . . .  
arbitrarily. . . . Those to whom the system brings windfalls, 
beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or 
desires,  become  “profiteers,”  who  are  the  object  of  the  ha-
tred  of  the  bourgeoisie,  whom  the  inflationism  has  impov-
erished. . . . All  permanent  relations  between  debtors  and 
creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, 
become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and 
the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a 
lottery. Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer 
means of overturning the existing basis of society than to de-
bauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces 
of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a 
manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.17

SO  WHY  THEN  WOULD  any  government—except  Lenin’s— 
resort to a policy of high inflation?

Suppose  that  a  government  has  made  big  promises,  telling 
people they will have incomes that will allow them to purchase 
good things in life substantially exceeding what the government 
can finance through its taxes, or indeed, what the economy can 
produce. How can it then square that circle? One road is for the 
government to borrow by issuing bonds. By borrowing, it asks 
some to forgo purchasing the good things in life, and in return 
promises  that  they  will  have  more  social  power  over  the  good 
things—more  money—in  the  future.  When  there  is  a  gap  be-
tween the goods and services citizens want the government to pay

for, on the one hand, and, on the other, the taxes that the largely 
rich are willing to pay, governments have to fill that gap—and 
printing interest-paying bonds and selling them for cash is the 
obvious way.

Whether  and  how  this  works  depends  on  the  expectations 
of  the  individuals—mostly  financiers—who  buy  and  hold  the 
bonds. How patient would they be? What kind of reward would 
they demand for holding and not selling the bonds? How trust-
ing of the government would they be? And how long would their 
trust last? In the aftermath of World War I, financiers had lim-
ited patience and demanded healthy returns. When that is the 
psychology of financiers—as it was after World War I—the most 
likely outcome of resorting to large-scale debt finance is provided 
by the one-equation model that economists call the fiscal theory 
of the price level:

Price Level = (Nominal Debt) × (Interest Rate) /  
(Real Debt Service Limit)

Take France in 1919 as an example. In June 1919, one French 
franc (₣) was worth US$0.15. In 1919, France had a nominal na-
tional debt of ₣200 billion, on which it owed interest at a rate of 
4 percent per year, so that the annual interest France paid on its 
national debt was ₣8 billion. If France’s real debt service limit—
the  real  resources  the  French  government  and  electorate  could 
mobilize to pay the interest on its debt—were equal to ₣8 billion 
per year at average 1919 prices, the equation would have balanced 
and France would not have experienced inflation in the 1920s:

1.00 = (nominal ₣200 billion × 4 percent per year) /  
(real ₣8 billion / year)

But it turned out that the real resources the French govern-
ment and electorate could mobilize to pay the interest on its debt

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

amounted to only ₣3.2 billon (at average 1919 prices). And fi-
nanciers did not have sufficient confidence to accept an interest 
rate of 4 percent per year—instead, they demanded 6 percent. So 
the fiscal theory of the price level equation was instead

3.75 = (nominal ₣200 billion × 6 percent per year) /  
(real ₣3.2 billion / year)

Equilibrium required that the average level of prices in France 
be 3.75 times their average level in 1919. And that would mean  
a value of the French franc of not ₣1 = US$0.15, but rather of  
₣1 = US$0.04. Guess where the French franc ultimately stabi-
lized in 1926? Yep: US$0.04. And that meant that France would 
have 20 percent average inflation for seven years—enough de-
bauching of the currency to significantly distort economic plan-
ning and hinder real growth throughout the 1920s.

Worse  outcomes  came  when  financiers’  trust  broke  down 
completely. That is the limit of hyperinflation, in which “worth 
less” becomes “worthless”: the money printed and the bonds sold 
by the government turn out to have no value at all. The ﬁrst post–
World War I hyperinflations took place in the successor states 
to the old Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the war, the former 
empire, which had been a single economic unit, was split among 
seven countries, each with its own currency and its own high tar-
iffs. The regional division of labor unwound.

Before  the  war  ended,  Joseph  Schumpeter,  just  thirty-four 
years  old  at  the  time,  had  set  out  the  resulting  problem:  “The 
material goods needed by the armies,” he said, had been provided 
and would continue to be provided. “After the war, we will be 
left . . . with a ‘monetary problem.’” He used an analogy, saying 
that countries paying for the war would be “in the position of an 
entrepreneur whose factory burnt down and now has to enter the 
losses in his books.”18

Joseph  Schumpeter  was  finance  minister  of  the  new  Aus-
trian Republic by 1919. He favored an immediate and substan-
tial  wealth  tax  on  all  real,  industrial,  commercial,  residential, 
and financial property to pay off the debt. The rest of the cab-
inet, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Otto Bauer, said yes 
to the wealth tax. But they wanted the proceeds to be used for  
“socialization”: buying up large Austrian companies, making them 
more efficient, and then using the profits from higher efficiency 
to first raise workers’ wages and only second to pay off the debt. 
Schumpeter parried that if socialization was “efficient,” then it did 
not need to be financed by the wealth tax. It would be what we 
now call an LBO, a leveraged buyout, and efficient LBOs finance 
themselves.

Schumpeter was fired. The cabinet dissolved into squabbling. 

The wealth tax was never levied.

Instead,  money  printing  presses  went:  “brrrrrr . . .”  Before 
World  War  I,  the  Austrian  crown  had  been  worth  a  little  less 
than twenty cents. By the late summer of 1922 the crown was 
worth 0.01 of a cent. The League of Nations—the international 
organization established at the end of World War I—provided a 
hard-currency loan on the condition that the Austrian govern-
ment surrender control over its own currency and ﬁnances. The 
budget was balanced by severe cuts in expenditures and higher 
taxes, and Austria remained depressed, with high unemployment, 
for half a decade.

In Germany prices rose a trillionfold: what had cost 4 Reichs-
marks in 1914 cost 4 trillion by the end of 1923. After the war, 
with respect to Germany, financiers had next to no patience and 
demanded exorbitant returns. The problem was the reparations 
that the Allies had imposed on Germany at the Treaty of Ver-
sailles, and the fact that it was absolute electoral poison for any 
German  politician  wanting  to  work  out  a  plan  to  actually  pay 
them. The German situation was not helped by the fact that it

was also electoral poison for French or British politicians to work 
out a feasible plan to actually make substantial reparations deliv-
eries, for then they would be assisting German workers in stealing 
jobs from British and French workers, who were then crowded 
out of their own domestic markets.19

The problem could perhaps have been finessed. France and 
Britain could have bought ownership shares of German compa-
nies with their reparations monies, and then been satisfied with 
the resulting income. German leaders could have induced their 
wealthy citizens to sell their ownership shares by levying higher 
taxes. But that would have required Allied governments willing to 
accept such a postponement, as well as transformation of short-
term demands for reparations payments now into long-term own-
ership shares, along with a German government strong enough to 
levy the taxes. The German government preferred to resist over 
figuring out a way to pay.

And so the bulk of the reparations burden was never paid. 
What was paid was financed by American investors. They made 
loans to Germany which Germany then turned around and trans-
ferred to the Allies. The American loans were a speculation on 
the success of Germany’s postwar Weimar Republic government. 
That speculation was not wise ex post. The German reparations 
burden was forgiven during the Great Depression.

The imposition of those reparations in the first place turned 
out to be a very costly political decision, for it set off a chain of 
events that ultimately led to the Depression. The weaknesses the 
reparations created did not lead directly to the rise of Adolf Hit-
ler—that came later. But they were key to the destabilization of 
the Weimar Republic, and to its pre-Hitler collapse from a parlia-
mentary democracy into a regime of Caesarist rule by presidential 
decree.

How  big  and  important  was  this  German  hyperinflation? 
Back in 1914, the German currency, the Reichsmark, had been 
worth  25  US  cents.  By  the  end  of  1919,  the  Reichsmark  was 

182

9780465019595_HC1P.indd   182

worth just 1 cent. It then recovered somewhat, reaching a value 
of 2 cents by the end of 1920. But the government kept spending 
and printing, and by the end of 1921, the mark was back down 
to 0.33 of a cent, an inflation rate of 500 percent per year, 16 
percent per month, 0.5 percent per day. By the end of 1922 the 
mark was worth only 0.0025 cents, an inflation rate of 13000 
percent per year, 50 percent per month, 1.35 percent per day.

For a while the government welcomed the inflation: it was 
easier to ﬁnance spending by printing money than by trying to 
collect taxes. Industrial and mercantile interests also beneﬁted: 
they borrowed from banks and repaid them in badly depreciated 
marks. For a while, labor beneﬁted too: unemployment almost 
vanished,  and  in  the  early  stages  of  the  inflation,  at  least  real 
wages and workers’ purchasing power did not fall. But in Jan-
uary 1923 the French government, to score domestic political 
points, sent in its army to occupy the Ruhr Valley and collect 
commodities at gunpoint. The German government and people 
responded with passive resistance. The inhabitants of the Ruhr 
went on strike. And the German government printed even more 
money to try to maintain the incomes of the passive resisters. 
By the end of 1923, the mark was worth 0.000000000025 of a 
cent, an inflation rate of 9999999900 percent per year, averag-
ing 364 percent per month, or 5 percent per day.

Of the countries that experienced post–World War I infla-
tion, Germany was hit the worst, with prices increasing, as men-
tioned above, by a trillionfold. But a number of other countries 
also saw inflation climb to devastating levels. In Russia prices 
rose four billionfold. In Poland they rose two and a half mil-
lionfold.  In  Austria,  prices  rose  two  thousandfold.  In  France, 
inflation  was  only  sevenfold,  which,  as  we  noted,  meant  that 
investors in French government debt from 1918 could, in 1927, 
purchase  only  one-seventh  as  much  with  their  bonds  as  they 
could  have  had  they  spent  rather  than  invested  their  money  
in 1918.

Driving this massive wave of inflation was the European focus 
on somehow appeasing those who had just lived through World 
War I: the maimed, the starved, and those grieving for lost broth-
ers, fathers, husbands, and sons—in the minds of many, the fallen 
needed to have died for something. So political leaders tried to 
create a “land fit for heroes.” In practice, this meant a govern-
ment commitment to social welfare and infrastructure programs 
to make life better, plus extension of voting rights to the male 
working class, and even to women. This had consequences. In 
Britain, for example, less than half of adult males could vote be-
fore World War I. In the election of 1918, the socialist Labour 
Party multiplied its vote sevenfold.

There  followed  disability  insurance  for  war  veterans,  un-
employment insurance (so that returning soldiers did not have 
to  beg  in  the  street),  mammoth  government  expenditures  (to 
repair war damage), more mammoth government expenditures 
(to make up for all the infrastructure and other investments not 
made during the war), plus even more mammoth government 
expenditures (to pay off the war debts). Voters and heroes de-
manded that governments compensate them for their property 
that  had  been  destroyed  or  that  had  lost  its  value  from  war- 
induced  dislocations.  And  voters  and  heroes  demanded  anew 
their  Polanyian  rights.  Old-age  pensions,  public  housing,  and 
public health insurance moved onto the agenda. Satisfying these 
demands would take vast resources. The world’s governments, 
with  their  national  economies,  were  all  poorer  than  they  had 
been in 1914, but the urge to spend was strong. The right did 
not dare resist it. The left did not have enough of an electoral 
mandate to make the rich pay. Financiers did not have the confi-
dence to fill the gap by holding the resulting debt at low interest 
rates. The result was that the fiscal theory of the price level came 
into play—and inflation.

From a narrow economists’ perspective, inflation is simply a 
tax, a rearrangement, and a confusion. It is a tax on cash, because 

184

your cash becomes worth less between when you acquire it and 
when you spend it. It is a rearrangement, as those who have bor-
rowed pay back their loans in depreciated currency, while those 
who have lent have to accept the depreciated currency. And it is 
a source of confusion, because it is difficult to calculate whether 
what you—as a company, a household, or an individual—are do-
ing makes economic sense when the numbers entered into your 
account books at different dates correspond to different amounts 
of real purchasing power.

All  of  these  elements  of  inflation,  and  especially  hyper-
inflation—the tax, the rearrangement, and the confusion—are de-
stroyers of trust. Trust in the economy, in society, in governments. 
And this destruction of trust, according to Keynes, was “fast ren-
dering impossible a continuation of the social and economic order 
of the nineteenth century. But [European leaders had] no plan for 
replacing it.” People who were not rich, but were well-off pillars 
of their community, who generally saw no great need to move to 
the political right, even as they feared the redistributionist plans of 
the left, were disturbed by inflation’s erosion of nominal forms of 
wealth. They felt cheated, and those who held government bonds 
felt cheated by the government. It was impossible for them to see 
that the market took just as it gave—and that it should, in fact, 
be blessed, not cursed. And no wonder—they were in the midst 
of seeing the abrupt revocation of their Polanyian right to stable 
finances and a certain standard of living.

NEARLY  EVERYONE  WITH  POWER or property sought a return 
to  what  US  president  Warren  G.  Harding  called  “normalcy.” 
Whatever had gotten broken during World War I needed to be 
fixed.  And  for  many,  that  meant  fixing  the  gold  standard:  the 
half- century-long general commitment of all the largest trading 
countries to buy and sell their currencies for gold at a fixed price. 
In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  World  War  I,  countries  agreed 

185

that they had to peg their currencies back to gold—and eventu-
ally they did.20

That pleased the rich, because it would guard against further 
inflation. In other words, any tendency toward inflation would 
generate, through capital flight or high import demand, a line 
of bankers at the central bank trying to turn currency into gold, 
unwinding inflationary pressures. Only Britain, with the Bank 
of England as the conductor of the international gold-standard 
order, got to raise and lower interest rates at home. This seemed 
a  good  system  both  for  Britain  and  for  world  trade.  After  all,  
the  pre–World  War  I  gold  standard  had  supported  the  fastest 
and  broadest  half-century  of  economic  growth  of  any  era  up  
until then.

During World War I, European finance ministers discovered 
the beneﬁts of inflation—indeed, given governments’ unwilling-
ness to raise taxes sufﬁciently to ﬁght the Great War, they found 
it to be a necessity. But you could not inflate if you kept your 
promise to buy and sell your currency for its fixed gold parity. 
So countries had dropped the gold standard during the war. And 
afterward, countries seeking normalcy sought to return to it.

Much easier sought than done. Wartime and postwar infla-
tion had, roughly, tripled prices worldwide. Banks and govern-
ments made sure that their transactions stayed greased by holding 
a roughly constant fraction of their payments flow in the form 
of gold assets, gold-as-reserves. Triple prices and you triple the 
nominal value of transactions. Triple the nominal value of trans-
actions, and you triple the gold you need to hold—unless you 
are willing to change the equivalency scale between gold bars and 
your currency.

After  wartime  and  postwar  inflations  and  hyperinflations, 
the  interwar  gold  standard  was  attempting  to  run  itself  with 
only one-third of the gold-as-reserves ratio of asset holdings to 
transaction amounts that had been needed for even semi-smooth

functioning  before  the  war.  It  simply  could  not  be  expected  
to work.

One place where it did not work was Britain. Even though 
wartime and postwar inflation was smallest in Britain, Britain 
found  itself  facing  a  fraught  situation.  It  had  seen  a  currency 
depreciation. Instead of the pegged value of GB£1 = US$4.86 
that had existed in July 1914, the market seemed to want to set-
tle the value of the British pound at slightly less than US$4.00. 
In advising British officials on how to respond, the financiers 
assured  them  that  the  government  would  win  a  great  deal  of 
long-term  market  trust  by  enacting  austerity  measures  to  re-
store  the  £1  =  US$4.86  pre–World  War  I  parity.  The  result, 
the financiers said, would be increased stability, lower interest 
rates, and faster growth. All the financiers sounded confident 
and credible.

The ruling politicians chose to follow their financiers’ advice. 
But in an economy where the market wanted a pound to be val-
ued at $3.80, the austerity measures needed to follow through on 
their plan required a 30 percent reduction in the average value of 
all wages and prices. In other words, deflation, which quickly led 
to high unemployment, bankruptcy driven by foreign competi-
tion, and an unrealistic exchange rate.

The decider in Britain in the mid-1920s was the finance min-
ister—chancellor of the exchequer—Winston Churchill. His pri-
vate  secretary,  P.  J.  Grigg,  reports  a  dinner  in  1924  hosted  by 
Churchill  at  which  supporters  and  opponents  of  returning  the 
pound to its prewar peg argued. One diner painted a grim picture 
of hobbled exports, unemployment, substantial downward pres-
sure on wages, and waves of strikes. The guest was John Maynard 
Keynes.

But hadn’t John Maynard Keynes burned his bridges with the 
British  establishment,  by  denouncing  the  British  government’s 
negotiating position after the war in the strongest possible terms?

Yes and no. By this time, he had attained a stature that meant he 
floated across even burned bridges.21

The Economic Consequences of the Peace had made Keynes fa-
mous.  In  the  words  of  biographer  Robert  Skidelsky,  the  econ-
omist  spoke  “like  an  angel  with  the  knowledge  of  an  expert.” 
Keynes was propelled by “passion and despair” and showed an ex-
traordinary mastery not just of economics, but also of the words 
that  were  needed  to  make  economics  persuasive.  He  became  a 
power to be conciliated—and at least listened to.

For after World War I, Keynes felt compelled to use what 
power he could command to—don’t laugh—restore civilization. 
Before the war, the world had been in a good place: economi-
cally, socially, culturally, and politically. Then the ruling elites 
had broken it. Now a road back had to be found. But simply 
winding  back  the  clock  to  the  1914  exchange-rate  parity  of  
GB£1  =  US$4.86  would  not  do  the  job.  Fundamentals  had 
changed  profoundly.  Smart  adaptation  was  needed.  Keynes’s 
influence, however, while sufficient to be invited to Churchill’s 
historic dinner, was not sufficient to nudge history, or, more pre-
cisely, politicians—or, more precisely still, Churchill.22

In 1919 the economic risks of returning to the prewar parity 
of pound to gold and dollar seemed vague, distant, and uncertain. 
The benefits of setting out on a path of further experimentation 
seemed unnecessary. The political risks of postponing the return, 
of continuing the experimentation, seemed large and immediate. 
The political risks of returning were the same as the economic 
risks:  vague,  distant,  and  uncertain.  The  decision  was  made  to 
return Britain to the gold standard.23

Great  Britain  returned  to  the  gold  standard  in  1925.  Brit-
ish industries, from coal mining to textiles to chemical and steel 
manufacturers, found themselves facing severe competitive diffi-
culties. This resulted in unemployment in export industries and a 
push for wage reductions to make domestic industry more com-
petitive. Moreover, sterling speculators could see what the Bank

of England could not: that returning to the gold standard at an 
overvalued parity weakened the pound sterling, creating a vulner-
ability. They began to pull their money out of Britain. In order 
to balance its payments, the Bank of England had to keep British 
interest rates above American interest rates. Higher interest rates 
depressed investment, further increasing unemployment.

Social conflict broke out in Britain over the distribution of 
the adjustment burden, ultimately leading to a general strike in 
1926. As a result, the British government began to subsidize its 
declining  and  uncompetitive  industries.  But  this  response  sim-
ply  allowed  the  economy  not  to  adjust  to  its  changed  circum-
stances—How would it ever boom?

At the end of the 1920s, citizens and voters in Western Europe 
at least could look back on not one but two low and dishonest de-
cades. Because of World War I, the 1910s had been the last gasp 
of  the  age  in  which  emperors,  aristocrats,  generals,  politicians, 
and soldiers had been in the saddle—and the result had been a 
near-complete human catastrophe. Then, in the aftermath of the 
war, came the 1920s, a decade in which calculators, economists, 
and politicians were in the saddle. While their policies had not 
killed ten million people, they had failed to bring rapid growth, 
stable incomes, stable prices, and full enough employment.

AMERICAN  ISOLATIONISM  IN  THE  1920s  was  not  limited  to 
avoiding  foreign  diplomatic  and  military  entanglements.  Com-
mercial  globalization  went  into  reverse—and  not  just  in  the 
United States, either. Up until 1950, globalization went into re-
cession and retreat worldwide.

Some of it was that in times of unemployment nations jeal-
ously guarded their markets, reserving them for their own pro-
duction. Some of it was that nations and their rulers feared that 
interdependence  could  be  weaponized—too  interdependent  an 
economy, that could be hobbled or crippled by an embargo, was

now seen as a political and perhaps a security risk. More of it was 
that interests that were being outcompeted and impoverished by 
globalization gained a greater political voice in polities that were 
increasingly  democratic  or  demagogic.  But  most  of  it  was  that 
domestic  manufacturing  productivity  levels  themselves  leaped 
ahead so rapidly without diverging substantially across countries. 
Whether it pays to trade something across oceans depends on (a) 
how high its production cost is relative to how much it costs to 
transport it, and (b) how large the proportional gaps in costs of 
production and demand for products are in different parts of the 
world that fuel potential gains from the trade.24 The coming of 
mass production and the assembly line caused (a) to shrink and 
did not increase (b). All of this meant that come 1950 interna-
tional trade was back to the 9 percent of global economic activity 
that it had been in 1800. The globalization cycle had been fully 
reversed.25

Furthermore,  many  influential  Americans  felt  that  curbing 

immigration should be an urgent priority.

There had been resistance to free immigration and open bor-
ders long before World War I. US senator Henry Cabot Lodge—a 
nativist WASPy Boston Brahmin and a Republican— had long 
beaten  the  drum—as  had  Progressive  Woodrow  Wilson,  seek-
ing to avoid social Darwinist corruption of the American race, 
by which they meant white people, a category they defined very 
narrowly.26 Most Italian immigrants, Lodge had said, were good, 
hardworking people. But some were members of the Mafia, and 
so  it  was  necessary  to  exclude  them.  Most  Polish  immigrants, 
Lodge said, were good, hardworking people, too. But there were 
terrorists among them—after all, it had been a second-generation 
Polish immigrant anarchist, Leon Czolgosz, who had murdered 
President  McKinley.  And  so  it  was  necessary  to  exclude  Poles  
as well.

Most  Irish,  Lodge  had  argued,  were  also  good  people— 
including many who had already been in America for generations,

especially those who were voters in Massachusetts, and who had 
elected  the  state  representatives  who  had  elected  Lodge  to  the 
US Senate. But among the more recent immigrants were those 
socialist-anarchist bomb-placing Molly McGuires. And so it was 
no less necessary to exclude the Irish.

Anarchists  were  a  danger—and  while  few  Jews  were  anar-
chists,  many  anarchists  were  Jews.  And  Jews  were  generally  a 
problem,  and  specifically,  a  political  problem.  The  Democrats 
were courting the Jewish vote—witness Woodrow Wilson’s nom-
ination to the Supreme Court of Louis Brandeis, a man Lodge 
declared underqualified and dangerously radical—and this would 
distort American politics in ways awful and conspiratorial. White 
people  of  British,  German,  Dutch,  French,  and  Scandinavian 
descent were assets to America, in their view. Irish were on the 
borderline— and were quickly assimilated to “British” by politi-
cians who had to run in districts where the Irish diaspora cast sub-
stantial votes. Others were more trouble than they were worth.

Setting  aside  the  occasional  self-serving  specific  instance, 
many  voting  Americans  were  of  Lodge’s  way  of  thinking—or 
worse.  Between  1900  and  1930  the  economic  and  social  posi-
tion of America’s Black middle class—W. E. B. Du Bois’s “Tal-
ented Tenth”—was reduced to rubble. Hollywood reinvigorated 
the Ku Klux Klan. It was the left-of-center president Woodrow 
Wilson, too, who segregated the federal civil service and set per-
sonnel management to downgrading Black workers. Progressive 
Republican president Theodore Roosevelt had invited Booker T. 
Washington to lunch at the White House. His cousin, Demo-
crat Franklin D. Roosevelt, had during World War I signed and 
transmitted the order segregating the bathrooms of what was then 
the State-War-Navy building in the White House complex.27

And by the mid-1920s, immigration restrictions against east-
ern and southern Europeans took hold. Back in 1914, more than 
1.2 million immigrants had come to the United States. By the 
mid-1920s, however, the immigration restrictions had fixed the 

191

number of immigrants allowed in each year at only 160,000 or so. 
Moreover, there were fixed quotas for each nation. The quotas for 
northern and western Europe were more than sufficient for the 
demand. The far lower quotas for immigrants from southern and 
eastern Europe were decidedly not. By 1930, there were 7 million 
missing Americans—people who would have immigrated were it 
not for Henry Cabot Lodge and company’s legislative success in 
1924. But America had kept building houses as though those 7 
million had arrived and were living in them. And it was valuing 
houses and apartment buildings as though those 7 million were 
purchasing them or paying rent.

Truth be told, many Americans were not alarmed by the turn 
inward. The United States of the 1920s had plenty to do, very 
much including becoming a middle-class economy of radios, con-
sumer appliances, automobiles, and suburbs. The utopian quali-
ties of the Jazz Age weren’t even sobered by the prohibition of the 
sale of alcohol. Nearly thirty million motor vehicles, one for every 
five Americans, were on the road by 1929. Assembly lines pow-
ered by electric motors in factories arranged for the convenience 
of workers made the post–World War I United States the richest 
society the world had ever seen. The world took notice.

In the middle of the 1800s, English engineers had spied some 
regularities in the way Americans seemed to do things. Ameri-
can manufacturing industries made simpler and rougher goods. 
American manufactures used much less skilled labor. American 
manufactures used up—the British would say “wasted”—lots of 
raw materials. American manufacturers paid their workers—even 
their unskilled workers—much better than did the British. And 
American manufacturers seemed to run the process of production 
relying on machines and organizations rather than on workers’ 
brains and hands.

This “American system of manufactures” was the brainchild 
of Eli Whitney, an inventor-promotor famous for inventing the 
cotton  gin,  which  made  American  short-staple  cotton  practical 

192

as an input for textile spinning. Truth be told, Eli Whitney was 
one-quarter  inventor,  one-quarter  salesman,  one-quarter  ma-
niac, and one-quarter fraud. The idea born of this combination 
was that American manufacturers could make the pieces of their 
goods  to  better,  tighter  specifications  in  order  to  make  parts 
interchangeable— the  barrel  of  one  firearm  would  fit  the  trigger 
mechanism  of  another.  It  was  an  idea  that  Eli  Whitney  could 
never quite make work, but it remained a very compelling idea.

The diffusion of American-system techniques played a sub-
stantial part in the late nineteenth-century growth of American 
manufacturing. Through the intermediation of the machine tool 
industry, companies such as Singer (making sewing machines), 
McCormick (making reapers and other agricultural machinery), 
and  the  Western  Wheel  Works  (making  bicycles)  all  adopted 
the strategy of trying to make their parts interchangeable, and so 
economize on the handling, fitting, and finishing costs that took 
up so much of skilled workers’ time.28

Economizing  costs,  certainly,  held  the  attention  of  nine-
teenth-century manufacturers. But more was needed: they aimed 
at also producing a higher-quality (though, note, not the highest- 
quality) product than would otherwise be possible, which they 
could then sell for a premium price.

The key difference between Henry Ford and his predecessors 
in using the “American system” for metalworking—and between 
Ford and his competitors abroad—was that Ford’s focus was not 
always on making a superior product (to sell to rich men with 
chauffeurs), but rather, on making a low-priced product he could 
sell to as many people as possible.

How?  Ford  minimized  his  costs  by  building  a  capital-  
intensive plant that was very good at building automobiles, but 
not at building anything else. This capital intensity carried risk. 
The productivity and proﬁtability of the Ford plant depended 
on a high rate of production. This was achieved in part by “mov-
ing the work to the men” by means of the assembly line (which 

193

9780465019595_HC1P.indd   193

became  another  fundamental  tenet  of  mass  production).  Ford 
engineers had found a method to speed up slow men. The pace 
of work could be increased. The monitoring of the worker could 
be increased. Unskilled workers could be substituted for skilled 
ones. The task of management was made much simpler than it 
had ever been before: the assembly line forced the pace of the 
slower workers and made it obvious where bottlenecks were oc-
curring.  Fixed  overhead  costs  were  spread  out  over  larger  and 
larger volumes of production, and thus lower and lower prices 
became possible.29

Henry Ford would have been happy if he could have found 
qualified workers for his assembly lines at low rates of pay. But 
he could not. Work on Ford’s emerging assembly line was brutal. 
Workers  paid  the  standard  wages  for  unskilled  labor  at  Ford’s 
Detroit  factory—a  little  less  than  $2  a  day—quit  at  astonish-
ing rates. In one year, 1913, Ford had an average annual labor 
force of 13,600, and yet 50,400 people quit or were fired. Ford’s 
workers—sped up, automated, short term, alienated, and about 
to quit—seemed like obvious fodder for recruitment into the In-
ternational Workers of the World, and Ford’s proﬁts were very 
vulnerable to IWW-style wildcat strikes.

Ford’s solution was a massive increase in wages: to $5 a day 
for unskilled workers, so long as their family circumstances and 
deportment satisfied Ford. By 1915, annual turnover was down 
from 370 percent to 16 percent. Many men who had found a 
Ford factory job not worth keeping at $1.75 a day found it more 
than bearable for $5 a day. Many more lined up outside the Ford 
factory for the chance to work at what appeared to them to be 
(and, for those who did not mind the pace of the assembly line 
much, was) an incredible boondoggle of a job.30

In the highly unequal, highly stratified America of the 1910s 
and  1920s,  the  idea  that  a  high-paid,  blue-collar,  semiskilled 
worker could be well in the upper half of the income distribu-
tion seemed radical. Yet it was happening in Detroit. And social

commentators,  and  Ford’s  imitators,  envisioned  the  spread  of 
mass production to the rest of the economy, making Detroit the 
rule rather than the exception. For all of this Ford became a ce-
lebrity, and a symbol. The extraordinary productivity of mass pro-
duction, as some nameless publicist began to call it, offered the 
prospect  of  a  ride  to  utopia  via  technology  alone.  Between  the 
world wars, Henry Ford was—as Aldous Huxley made him out 
to be in his ambiguously dystopian novel Brave New World—a 
legend, a mythical figure, a near-Moses to the world.

Not everyone was convinced, and a few were outright suspi-
cious. The boogiemen of Lodge’s dire warnings, the anarchists 
and the socialists, were real, even if much of their influence over 
events  wasn’t.  And  however  ambiguous,  Huxley’s  Brave  New 
World  was  still  clearly  dystopian.  Fordism  as  fictionalized  by 
Huxley gave rise to a world not everyone would, or should, wish 
to live in.

Like  many  of  the  long  century’s  most  prominent  figures, 
Ford managed to retain much of the world’s regard even as his 
ideas became wilder, crankier, crueler, and more prejudiced. His 
brave new world of mass production was certainly a shock to all 
who thought, as Polanyi had, that they deserved stability. But it 
brought wonderful new, visible, and tangible things, including 
radios,  cars,  and  square  footage.  A  little  instability  could  then 
be dealt with, and some of the wild and cranky and cruel could 
then be overlooked. All in all, America’s mass-produced future 
looked bright.

Increasingly,  America’s  decision  makers  believed  that  the 
key to the modern business enterprise lay in creating enormous 
economies of scale that could be realized by a large, vertically in-
tegrated organization able to plan the flow of raw materials into 
the factory and the flow of finished goods out into distribution 
channels.  The  realization  of  these  economies  of  scale  required 
the  highest  output,  as  well  as  the  lowest  practicable  prices  to 
make sure that the output could be sold. But corporations like

Ford’s were proving this formula to be practical, or at least prac-
tical enough.

Theodore  N.  Vail,  president  of  American  Telegraph  and 
Telephone in the early twentieth century, distinguished two dif-
ferent strategies for generating net revenue: “by a large percentage 
of proﬁt on a small business, or a small percentage of proﬁt on a 
large business.” And in America, the second was best.31

Manufacturers  of  mass-produced  items,  however,  faced  a 
problem literally of their own creation. Once the market had been 
saturated, replacement demand of the same product dropped con-
siderably.  Producers  needed  consumers  who  would  not  simply 
“replace” but would “upgrade.” This was a big problem for Ford. 
He had adhered to changelessness for ideological as well as pro-
duction-based  reasons.  It  became  an  especially  knotty  problem 
because, it turned out, consumers, unlike Ford, wanted novelty. 
They were (and are) willing to pay a premium to have not only a 
car, but a car different from some, even most, of their neighbors.32
Aldous Huxley had believed that it would require sophisti-
cated psychological manipulation to persuade people to buy what 
mass production could produce: which is exactly what he depicts 
in  Brave  New  World.33  The  real  world  proved  much  simpler: 
make it, and tell people you’ve made it (with some pictures of 
people using it, having more fun than you will ever have in your 
lifetime), and the public will buy it.

What Ford wrestled with, Alfred P. Sloan, at General Motors, 
embraced. Make the guts of the cars the same, so as to take full 
advantage of economies of scale, put the guts in differently col-
ored boxes, and rely on advertising to create different auras sur-
rounding different lines of cars. Some psychology was certainly 
involved, but sophisticated? No.

It is natural to be of two minds about this surge of product 
differentiation. It seems wasteful and deceptive. Yet product dif-
ferentiation, monopolistic competition, and even advertising are 
all genuinely popular. Mass production plus mass consumption is

what made the creation of America as a middle-class society pos-
sible—a middle-class society made up increasingly of people liv-
ing in suburban houses and using automobiles to commute and 
shop, with washing machines, refrigerators, electric irons, electric 
and gas stoves, and much more. A whole host of inventions and 
technologies that greatly transformed the part of economic life 
that takes place within the household became interwoven with 
the public’s understanding of Polanyian rights.

Back before World War I, the United States had had the most 
virulent business cycle in the industrialized part of the world. A 
huge crash and depression occurred after the 1873 bankruptcy 
of  Jay  Cooke  and  Company,  then  the  largest  investment  bank 
in the nation, when the public subsidies for the Northern Pacific 
Railroad  that  it  had  counted  on  failed  to  materialize.  Another 
major railroad-crash depression started in 1884. Another depres-
sion ensued in the early 1890s, when fears that the United States 
might abandon the gold standard set British and urban eastern 
capital fleeing the country—though J. P. Morgan profited hand-
somely from betting that Grover Cleveland would stay the gold-
s tandard course, and lent him the cash to allow him to do so. 
Then there was the Panic of 1901, generated as a byproduct of a 
fight between E. H. Harriman and J. P. Morgan over control of 
the Northern Pacific Railroad. The Panic of 1907 came next, and 
was only kept from turning into a Great Depression–like event 
when J. P. Morgan decided to do what the Bank of England had 
been doing since the 1820s—backing banks that were in trouble 
until the crisis passed. The Bank of England could do so by print-
ing banknotes that were legal tender. Morgan did so by printing 
“clearing house certificates,” and telling everyone that if they did 
not accept them as if they were cash, he would ruin them after the 
crisis was over—and he had a good memory.34

Afterward, however, politicians and bankers alike thought it 
was not for the best that central-banking panic-fighting functions 
could be carried out in the private sector by a ruthless and greedy,

if highly competent, financier. The United States had not had 
anything like a central bank since Andrew Jackson had vetoed the 
Second Bank of the United States’ recharter as a threat to liberty 
in the 1830s. The United States got a central bank in 1913, the 
Federal Reserve, tasked with keeping the financial system sound 
and liquid, so that the wheels of commerce and industry could 
turn smoothly. And so, after World War I, for about a decade, for 
most Americans, the market gaveth and rarely tooketh, so blessed 
be the market. And all this was achieved without the bother of 
taking on hegemonic responsibility for stabilizing the world as a 
whole. It was enough to stabilize the United States.

One substantial cheerleader and bridge builder for the rapid 
buildout of American industrialization in the 1920s was Herbert 
Hoover. Woodrow Wilson had pulled Hoover off of his Belgian 
relief projects and set him up as the “food czar” of America. Con-
gress in 1919 gave Hoover $100 million to spend—and he raised 
another $100 million—to pay for postwar food relief. With the 
change of administration from Democrats back to Republicans 
in 1921, President Warren Harding made a concession to bipar-
tisanship,  or  rather  progressivism,  and  to  the  idea  of  a  can-do 
government, by naming Hoover secretary of commerce, a job he 
held from 1921 to 1928.35

Hoover thought the secretary of commerce ought to be the 
management  consultant  for  every  single  company  in  America, 
and  the  person  who  drove  the  other  departments  to  cooperate 
and aid American industry. He promoted aviation. He promoted 
radio. He was ringmaster for the federal aid response to the Great 
Mississippi Flood of 1927. And he ran for and got the Republi-
can presidential nomination in the summer of 1928, and then 
beat Democrat Al Smith in the 1928 presidential election.

At the end of 1928, in his last State of the Union message to 
Congress, President Calvin Coolidge began with, “No Congress 
of the United States ever assembled, on surveying the state of the

Union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which 
appears at the present time.” All, the outgoing president declared, 
should  “regard  the  present  with  satisfaction  and  anticipate  the 
future with optimism.” And indeed, nearly everyone in America 
in the 1920s had good reasons to be optimistic: the United States 
appeared to be riding a wave of innovation and invention that 
was carrying the country toward higher prosperity more rapidly 
than any previous generation would have believed.36

Automobiles and other consumer durables, especially radios, 
became leading sectors. The electric motor and electricity became 
prime movers in industrial production. The growth of the utili-
ties sector was interlinked with these. With electrification, poten-
tial demand for the services provided by utilities was immense, 
rapidly  growing,  and  predictable.  Their  plant  costs  were  fixed. 
And nearly all utilities had near monopolies.

The clear utilities strategy was to use the underlying sound-
ness of the industry as collateral to borrow money from banks, 
use  that  money  to  purchase  more  utilities,  take  advantage  of 
engineering economies of scale to lower costs, reap the profits, 
and make sure the profits were shared with the right people, in 
order to keep potential regulators sweet on the industry. Samuel 
Insull, a utilities magnate based in Chicago, became a prince of 
infrastructure with this strategy, and he might well have domi-
nated midcentury American capitalism had not the jealousy and 
greed of investment bankers led them to withdraw their support  
for him.

Not that there was no malcontent. In the United States the 
rising concentration of wealth provoked a widespread feeling that 
something had gone wrong. Explaining exactly what, however, 
was difficult, and no faction or group was able to effectively turn 
that  malcontent  into  political  energy.  The  Populists  had  been 
broken  in  the  1890s  by  a  combination  of  anti-Black  prejudice 
and an increased sense that inequality was regional and poverty

was rural. And the Progressive tide ebbed as moderates embraced 
only  moderate  reforms.  Voters,  meanwhile,  continued  to  elect 
Republican presidents who were more or less satisfied with Amer-
ican economic and social developments, and who believed that 
“the business of America is business.”37

Still, the managers who ran America’s firms and the politi-
cians who got elected were not oblivious to the Progressive chal-
lenge. Scared of what unionization or a shift to left-wing politics 
might bring, and concerned about the welfare of their workers, 
American business leaders in the 1920s developed “welfare capi-
talism.” Social-work professionals employed by the firm provided 
counseling  and  visited  workers’  homes.  The  businesses  offered 
stock-purchase  plans,  to  help  workers  save  for  retirement,  and 
sickness, accident, and life insurance.38

With  welfare  capitalism  unevenly  distributed,  socialism 
and social democracy were deemed moot, unnecessary, and un- 
American.  The  long-run  interest  of  American  companies  was 
to take care of their workers, a fact as obvious as Henry Ford’s 
$5-a-day wage and the Pullman Company’s worker housing.

As the 1920s proceeded, Americans forgot about the deep re-
cessions of the pre–World War I period and began to accept that 
they were living in a “new era” of faster economic growth and 
general prosperity. The recently established Federal Reserve had 
the tools to calm the business cycle. The systematic application 
of science to technology in research laboratories was generating 
an ever-accelerating stream of new inventions. This world was, 
if you looked selectively at the facts, brave and new and ambig-
uously utopian. Why shouldn’t people in America in the 1920s 
have expected prosperity to continue, and economic growth to 
accelerate?

One consequence of this seemingly permanent “new era” was 

that financial asset prices went up.

To properly value any given financial asset, first we need to 
take  the  rate  of  return  the  market  requires  on  safe  assets—for

example, the bonds of the world’s most trustworthy government. 
Second, we add on an appropriate adjustment for the risk of the 
asset. Third, subtract from that adjusted rate of return the rate 
at which you expect the payments from the asset to grow (for a 
constant-coupon bond, that rate will be zero; for a stock, it will 
be the expected rate of earnings growth). Call this the “adjusted 
yield factor.” Fourth, divide the current payout of the asset—its 
bond coupon or stock dividend payment—by the adjusted yield 
factor. This gives the price the asset should sell for. Americans in 
the 1920s who bothered to do all four steps did so with presump-
tions that told them the asset’s price had to go up.

The result of was widespread faith in the permanent “new 
era” of low risks, low-interest rates produced by successful macro-
economic stabilization, rapid growth produced by new technol-
ogy, and confidence that in the future, depressions would be few 
and small. Concretely, this meant very high prices for financial 
assets, especially stocks, and especially stock in high-tech com-
panies. Monetary economist (and Prohibition enthusiast) Irving 
Fisher ruined his reputation as an economic forecaster for all time 
with  his  late-1929  declaration  that  “stock  prices  have  reached 
what looks like a permanently high plateau.” True, he declared 
this to a near-universal sea of heads nodding in agreement.39

That the US stock market did go off its rails is clear. A host 
of anomalies in stock-market values indicate that those who were 
paying for stocks in the summer and early fall of 1929 had not the 
slightest rational clue of what they were doing.

Consider the closed-end investment fund. A closed-end in-
vestment fund is a pure holding company. Investors were sup-
posed to pool their resources and limit their risk by buying stock 
in this holding company, this closed-end investment fund, which 
would then buy and hold for them the stock of one hundred or 
more individual operating companies. The theory was that the 
management of the fund would be better able to pick stocks and 
manage risk than individual investors.

In  practice,  this  meant  that  the  only  assets  of  a  closed-end 
investment fund were its financial assets: the stocks and bonds 
that it held. By elementary principles of rational finance, there-
fore, the fundamental value of a closed-end investment fund was 
nothing more than the current value of the stocks and bonds that 
made up its portfolio. Yet by the fall of 1929 closed-end invest-
ment funds were selling at a 40 percent premium relative to their 
net asset values.40

According to the “rules of the game” of the gold standard, 
a  country  that  receives  an  inflow  of  gold  is  supposed  to  use  it 
to back an expansion of its money stock, which in turn triggers 
inflation. That inflation then encourages the country to import 
more and export less, so trade rebalances. But neither the United 
States nor France was willing to tolerate domestic inflation. They 
squirreled the gold away in their government vaults. Both began 
to view their gold reserves not as shock absorbers, but rather as 
national  treasures,  to  be  defended  and  hoarded—and  any  out-
ward flow would be viewed a defeat.

The United States and France held more than 60 percent of 
the world’s monetary gold by 1929. The global price level was 
twice what it had been in 1914. Outside the United States and 
France, countries undertaking to trade did so with only a fraction 
of the world’s gold. As a consequence, a single gold coin or gold 
bar  had  to  do  more  than  five  times  the  work  that  it  normally 
would have of cushioning shocks, providing liquidity, and creat-
ing trust.41

After  the  fact,  economists  Friedrich  von  Hayek  and  Lionel 
Robbins blamed the Great Depression that started in 1929 on 
the Federal Reserve’s unwillingness to raise interest rates earlier. 
They pointed to the Fed’s decision (at the request of the Reichs-
bank and the Bank of England) to cut the discount rate at which 
it  lent  to  banks  from  4  to  3.5  percent  in  the  spring  of  1927. 
They claimed that this shift in the rate was clearly inflationary, 
that it made money too inexpensively available to the economy,

and that it ultimately drove the inflationary boom that led to the 
speculative mania of 1929.42

We know today that this is wrong, because we have the ben-
efit  of  knowing  what  excessively  inflationary  monetary  policy 
looks like: it looks like the United States between 1965 and 1973. 
The late 1920s were nothing of the sort: overall prices remained 
constant. The goods and product markets showed no sign of too 
much money chasing too few goods.

Economists such as Milton Friedman make a more convinc-
ing case, claiming that the Federal Reserve was not too expan-
sionary but too contractionary in the run-up to the 1929 stock 
market crash. From 1928 on, Federal Reserve officials began to 
worry that gold might start flowing out if they did not raise inter-
est rates. They also worried that stock prices were too high, that 
they might end in a crash, and that such a crash might bring on 
a depression. So they took measures to try to choke off both gold 
outflows and stock market speculation by making it more expen-
sive to borrow money. They succeeded in the first. They failed in 
the second.43

It  seems  as  though  the  Federal  Reserve’s  attempts  to  keep 
stock market overvaluation from growing large enough to trigger 
a crash were counterproductive. In fact, they triggered a crash—
and then a recession—all by themselves. The US economy en-
tered a cyclical downturn in June 1929. By that time, the German 
economy  had  already  been  in  recession  for  almost  a  year.  The 
Great Depression had begun.

The Great Depression

U nderstanding the Great Depression begins by looking back 

at the first economists’ debates early in the 1800s. Econ-
omists  then  saw  the  market  economy  emerging.  They  worried 
that  things  would  not  necessarily  fit  together  smoothly.  Might 
not the farmers be unable to sell the crops they grew to the arti-
sans, because the artisans could not sell the products they made 
to the merchants, who would be unable to make money carrying 
artisans’ products to the farmers, because the farmers would not 
purchase anything?

The French economist Jean-Baptiste Say wrote in 1803 that 
there was no cause for worry. Such a “general glut”—economy- 
wide “overproduction” or “under demand,” and consequent mass 
unemployment—was  incoherent.  Nobody,  Say  argued,  would 
ever  produce  anything  for  sale  unless  they  expected  to  use  the 
money they earned in order to buy something else.1 And so “by 
a  metaphysical  necessity,”  as  subsequent-generation  economist 
John Stuart Mill wrote in 1829, summarizing Say’s 1803 argu-
ment, there could be no imbalance between the aggregate value of 
planned production-for-sale, the aggregate value of planned sales, 
and the aggregate value of planned purchases. This is “Say’s Law.”2
Now  Say  stressed  that  this  equality  only  applied  to  econo-
my-wide totals. Individual commodities could be and often were

in excess demand, with buyers unsatisfied and rapidly increasing 
the prices they were willing to pay—or excess supply, with sellers 
rapidly cutting the prices at which they had planned to sell. The 
idea that you could have excess demand for (and therefore high 
profits  in)  scarce  commodities,  or  excess  supply  of  (and  there-
fore losses in) overabundant commodities—this was not a bug, 
but  a  feature.  The  market  provided  incentives  to  quickly  shift 
resources to erase such imbalances. But a deficiency of demand 
relative  to  production  of  well-nigh  everything?  That,  Say  said, 
was impossible.

Other economists questioned Say’s conclusion. What if you 
wanted to buy before you had sold—if the artisan wanted to buy 
food before the merchant had come around to buy the textiles? 
That, said Say, was what banks and trade credit were for: “Mer-
chants know well enough how to find substitutes for the product 
serving as the medium of exchange.” Karl Marx dismissed this as 
the “childish babble of a Say.”3 One did not just sell in order to 
buy: one might be forced to sell in order to pay off an old debt, 
if credit that had been extended by some bank was withdrawn. 
In that case, the demand for goods was in the past, and could not 
in the present balance out your supply. If everyone was trying to 
sell in order to pay off old debts, there would indeed be a “gen-
eral glut.” And if those who were calling in loans saw businesses 
collapsing into bankruptcy around them, they would be unlikely 
to provide “substitutes for the product serving as the medium of 
exchange.”

Say was wrong. As economist Thomas Robert Malthus had 
vaguely intuited in 1819, and as the young John Stuart Mill had 
nailed it in 1829, there can be an excess demand for money along 
with an excess supply of pretty much everything else.4

If a manufacturer has excess demand for a good, he can re-
spond by raising its price. If it is a good you want, you can respond 
by being willing to pay more for it. And this, in turn, may well 
cause you to want to have more money with which to buy more

of this good and others like it. Something similar happens when 
there is an excess demand for money. People who are demanding 
it can “buy” more money by working longer and harder. But be-
cause money is special, you can do something else as well. You can 
stop your spending. And when you stop spending, your counter-
parties lose their markets, their income, and their work.5

If money is in excess demand and so an increasing number 
of goods and services swing into excess supply, factories will be 
shut and workers will be jobless. That shareholders then have no 
dividends, lenders have no interest payments, and workers have 
no wages will only further widen the gap between the aggregate- 
supply productive potential of the economy and the current level 
of aggregate demand.

Say  came  to  recognize  the  point  that  Marx  and  Mill  (and 
others) would make after the British Canal Panic of 1825.6 The 
banks and merchants of England decided in late 1825 that they 
had made too many loans to too many counterparties whose in-
vestments  were  not  turning  out  well.  So  they  stopped  advanc-
ing cash in return for merchants’ promised future earnings from 
customers. Thus, Say wrote, “commerce found itself deprived at 
a stroke of the advances on which it had counted,” which ulti-
mately  led  to  financial  and  economic  collapse,  a  true  “general 
glut.” Money and credit are, after all, liquid trust. And if there is 
not trust that your counterparty is solvent, the money and credit 
will not be there.

However,  there  is  one  organization  that  is  almost  always 
trusted  to  be  good  for  the  money.  The  government  accepts  as 
payment for taxes the money that it issues itself. Because of this, 
everybody who owes taxes will be willing to sell what they have 
in return for the government-issued money. Whenever the econ-
omy freezes up due to a shortage of demand and income, the gov-
ernment can fix it—as long as its own finances are trusted over 
the long term—by increasing the amount of government- issued 
cash in the public’s hands. People then will be able to buy. Their

purchases  then  become  extra  income  for  others.  Those  others  
will then be able to scale up their purchases. And so the economy 
will unwedge itself—if the government acts properly to enable it 
to do so.

There are a number of ways the government can get extra pur-
chasing power into the hands of the public to cure a depression:
It  can  have  its  functionaries  throw  bundles  of  cash  out  of  
helicopters—an arresting idea first proposed by Milton Friedman 
(a reference to which earned former US Federal Reserve chair Ben 
Bernanke his nickname of “Helicopter Ben”).

It can hire people, set them to work, and pay them.
It can simply buy useful stuff, and so provide the extra de-
mand to make it profitable for employers to hire more people, set 
them to work, and pay them.

It can have an arm—a central bank—that trades financial as-

sets for cash.

The  last  of  these  options  is  the  one  most  favored  by  gov-
ernments  in  recent  history.  In  response  to  the  Canal  Crisis  of 
1825, the Bank of England took major steps to boost the cash 
holdings—and the spending—of the banks, businesses, and in-
dividuals of England.7 As Jeremiah Harman, then one of the di-
rectors of the Bank of England, wrote, “We lent [cash] by every 
possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we 
took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made 
advances  on  Exchequer  bills,  we  not  only  discounted  outright, 
but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an 
immense  amount,  in  short,  by  every  possible  means  consistent 
with the safety of the Bank, and we were not on some occasions 
over-nice. Seeing the dreadful state in which the public were, we 
rendered every assistance in our power.”8

Despite these efforts, there was a depression: 16 percent less 
cotton  was  spun  into  yarn  in  England  in  1826  than  had  been 
spun in 1825. But the depression was short: 1827 saw 30 per-
cent more cotton spun into yarn than 1826 had. Could it have

been worse? Absolutely. Indeed, there is good reason to think that 
the downturn would have been considerably worse had the Bank 
of England behaved the same way the US Treasury and Federal  
Reserve did in the early 1930s.

AS  THE  WORLD  SLID  into the Great Depression from 1929 to 
1933, central banks did not take large-scale emergency steps to 
put cash into the hands of the public. It is straightforward to nar-
rate  the  slide.  It  is  more  complicated,  however,  to  understand  
why these central banks sat on their hands.

The 1920s had seen a stock market boom in the United States 
that was the result of general optimism. Businessmen and econo-
mists believed that the newly born Federal Reserve would stabilize 
the economy, and that the pace of technological progress guaran-
teed rapidly rising living standards and expanding markets. The 
Federal  Reserve  feared  that  continued  stock  speculation  would 
produce a huge number of overleveraged financial institutions that 
would go bankrupt at the slightest touch of an asset price drop. 
Such a wave of bankruptcies would then produce an enormous 
increase in fear, a huge flight to cash, and the excess demand for 
cash that is the flip side of a “general glut.” The Federal Reserve 
decided that it needed to curb the stock market bubble to prevent 
such speculation. And so it came to pass that its attempt to head 
off a depression in the future brought one on in the present.9

Previous  depressions  had  been—and  future  depressions 
would be—far smaller than the Great Depression. In the United 
States, the most recent economic downturns had inflicted sig-
nificantly  less  damage:  in  1894,  the  unemployment  rate  had 
peaked  at  12  percent;  in  1908,  at  6  percent;  and  in  1921,  at 
11  percent.  The  highest  unemployment  rate  reached  between 
World War II and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 was 11 
percent.  In  the  Great  Depression,  the  US  unemployment  rate 
peaked at 23 percent—and at 28 percent for nonfarm workers

(in the family-farm sector, “unemployment” is harder to mea-
sure). Some of the greatness of the Great Depression was a result 
of the relative expansion of the nonfarm sector at the expense 
of the family-farm sector: working from the best available data, 
I  estimate  that  the  nonfarm  unemployment  rate  peaked  at  14 
percent in 1921, and working backward in time, at 8 percent in 
1908, 20 percent in 1894, and 11 percent in 1884. Depressions 
with  large-scale  unemployment  are  a  disease  of  the  nonfarm 
economy of workers and businesses, not of a yeoman farmer or 
even an independent craftsman economy.

But even taking the growing relative size of the industrial and 
nonfarm sectors into account, the Great Depression was greater 
and  longer  by  far  than  any  previous  depressions  or  any  since. 
Others  had  produced  one  big  shock  that  threw  people  out  of 
work and shuttered factories and businesses, after which recov-
ery  began,  sometimes  rapidly  and  sometimes  slowly,  as  people 
picked  themselves  up,  confidence  returned,  the  excess  demand 
for money ebbed, and people no longer wished to hoard as much 
cash against future emergencies.

The Great Depression was different. The start of the recession 
in mid-1929 was the first shock to confidence. The stock market 
crash of late 1929 was a consequence of both that shock and of 
overleverage, and was itself a second, major confidence shock that 
quickly reverberated around the entire world. Then, a year later, 
came a banking crisis in the United States. The thought that the 
money  you  had  been  depositing  in  the  bank  might  get  locked 
away and become inaccessible—or vanish completely—caused a 
run on banks. Bank deposits ceased to be fully “money” because 
you could not be confident they would still be there when you 
needed them. So people demanded more money, this time in-
sisting  that  it  be  in  the  particular  form  of  visible  cash,  further 
boosting the excess demand for money. March 1931 saw a second 
banking crisis. The summer and fall of 1931 saw panics in other

countries, which made the Great Depression great worldwide—
and greatest in Germany.10

Up  until  late  1930,  people  continued  clamoring  for  cash. 
With the Roaring Twenties over and the stock market in a pro-
nounced  bear  market,  demand  for  cash  was  high.  But  shortly 
thereafter, banks began to get scared and to restrict the amount of 
cash they were willing to provide to their customers. They called 
in loans and canceled lines of credit as they sought to raise the ra-
tio of their own reserves held against the deposits they owed their 
customers. And households began to want to raise their curren-
cy-to-deposits ratio: to hold more cash under the mattress than 
in the bank.

From late 1930 into 1933, month by month, these reserves- 
to-deposits  and  currency-to-deposits  ratios  grew  as  confidence 
fell, and so month by month the money supply shrank. During 
that period, 1931 had been a year of banking and international 
financial crises; 1932 saw no large extra crises, but it also saw no 
recovery,  as  the  situation  had  become  so  dire  and  so  unprece-
dented that there was no recovery of confidence.

Conventional anti-Keynesian economic thinking would hold 
that any depression will be cured faster if wages and prices are 
encouraged—or  forced—to  fall  in  nominal  terms.  The  same 
amount of spending in dollars will then buy more stuff and pro-
vide demand for more people to work. The problem is that when 
wages and prices fall, debts do not fall along with them. Thus, 
a  decline  in  prices—deflation—during  the  Depression  caused 
bankruptcies—companies unable to pay their debts—which led 
to further contractions in production, which triggered additional 
falls in prices, bankruptcies, and so on.

Banking panics and the collapse of the world monetary sys-
tem cast doubt on everyone’s credit and reinforced the belief that 
the early 1930s was a time to watch and wait. Demand for cash 
went up, and the excess supply of goods and services grew. And

with prices falling at 10 percent per year, investors had compel-
ling  reasons  to  sit  on  the  sidelines.  Investing  now  would  earn 
them less proﬁt than if they waited to invest next year, when their 
dollars would stretch 10 percent further. The slide into the De-
pression, with increasing unemployment, falling production, and 
falling prices, continued throughout then newly elected Herbert 
Hoover’s presidential term.

At  its  nadir,  the  Depression  was  collective  insanity.  Work-
ers were idle because ﬁrms would not hire them to work their 
machines; ﬁrms would not hire workers to work their machines 
because they saw no market for goods; and there was no market 
for goods because idle workers had no incomes to spend. Jour-
nalist and novelist George Orwell’s 1936 account of the Great 
Depression in Britain, The Road to Wigan Pier, speaks of “several 
hundred  men  risk[ing]  their  lives  and  several  hundred  women 
scrabbl[ing] in the mud for hours . . . searching eagerly for tiny 
chips of coal” in slagheaps so they could heat their homes. For 
them, this “free” coal was “more important almost than food.” 
While they risked and scrabbled, all around them the machinery 
they had previously used to mine in ﬁve minutes more coal than 
they could now gather in a day stood idle.11

There is no fully satisfactory explanation for why the Great 
Depression happened just when it did, and why there was only 
one. If such huge depressions were always a possibility in an un-
regulated capitalist economy, why weren’t there two, three, or 
more of them in the years before World War II? Milton Fried-
man and Anna Schwartz would later argue that the Depression 
resulted  from  an  incredible  sequence  of  blunders  in  monetary 
policy.  But  those  controlling  policy  during  the  early  1930s 
thought they were following the same gold-standard rules that 
their predecessors had used. Were they wrong? If they were not 
wrong, why was the Great Depression the only Great Depression?
A number of pieces of bad luck did all come together. In the 
United States, the decision to cut immigration in 1924 meant

was undertaken for people who, it turned out, did not exist—or, 
rather, existed elsewhere. The rapid expansion of financial mar-
kets, and broader participation in them, made them more vul-
nerable than usual to overspeculation and panic. The shortage of 
monetary gold to act as a shock absorber, due to France and the 
United States deciding to lock it in their vaults, played a role. The 
international monetary system’s reliance not just on gold but on 
other assets—assets also subject to runs—played a role as well.

When I first started writing this book, I felt, as many others 
did, that 1929–1933 was a uniquely vulnerable time, and planned 
to devote considerable space to explaining why. But in 2008, we 
skated to the edge of another Great Depression (which we’ll ex-
plore in more detail in Chapter 17), which made it painfully clear 
that the years 1929–1933 were not so uniquely vulnerable after 
all. Rather, we had been remarkably lucky before 1929, and we 
had been remarkably lucky after 1929.

In the lead-up to the Great Depression, policy elites doubled 
down  on  the  austerity  measures  to  which  they  had  committed 
themselves in the late 1920s. Faced with the gathering depres-
sion,  the  ﬁrst  instinct  of  governments  and  central  banks  was 
to  do,  well,  nothing.  Businessmen,  economists,  and  politicians 
expected  the  recession  of  1929–1930  to  be  self-limiting.  They 
expected  workers  with  idle  hands  and  capitalists  with  idle  ma-
chines to try to undersell their still at-work peers. Prices would 
fall. When prices fell enough, entrepreneurs would gamble that 
even with slack demand, production would be proﬁtable at the 
new, lower wages. Production would then resume. This is how 
earlier recessions had come to an end.

Throughout  the  decline—which  saw  the  unemployment 
rate rise to nearly a quarter of the US workforce, and production 
per worker fall to a level 40 percent below where it had been in 
1929—the government did not try to prop up aggregate demand. 
The Federal Reserve did not use open-market operations to keep

the money supply from falling. Instead, the only signiﬁcant sys-
tematic  use  of  open-market  operations  was  in  the  other  direc-
tion. After the United Kingdom abandoned the gold standard in 
the fall of 1931, the Fed raised interest rates to discourage gold 
outflows.12

The Federal Reserve thought it knew what it was doing: it 
was letting the private sector handle the Depression in its own 
fashion. And it feared that expansionary monetary policy or fiscal 
spending and the resulting deficits would impede the necessary 
private-sector process of readjustment.

The Fed’s do-little-to-nothing approach was backed by a large 
chorus, which included some of the most eminent economists of 
the era.

For  example,  Harvard’s  Joseph  Schumpeter  argued  that  
“de pres  sions  are  not  simply  evils,  which  we  might  attempt  to 
suppress, but forms of something which has to be done, namely, 
adjustment to change.”13 Friedrich von Hayek wrote, “The only 
way permanently to mobilize all available resources is, therefore, 
to leave it to time to effect a permanent cure by the slow process 
of adapting the structure of production.”14

Hayek and company believed that enterprises were gambles 
that sometimes failed. The best that could be done in such cir-
cumstances was to shut down those that turned out to have been 
based on faulty assumptions about future demands. The liquida-
tion of such investments and businesses released factors of pro-
duction from unproﬁtable uses so that they could be redeployed. 
Depressions,  said  Hayek,  were  this  process  of  liquidation  and 
preparation for the redeployment of resources.

Schumpeter put it this way: “Any revival which is merely due 
to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions un-
done and adds, to an undigested remnant of maladjustment, new 
maladjustment of its own which has to be liquidated in turn, thus 
threatening  business  with  another  [worse]  crisis  ahead.”15  The 
market giveth, the market taketh away, and—in this case—blessed

be the name of the market through gritted teeth. Except many 
didn’t just grit their teeth, they also cursed loudly and repeatedly.
Herbert  Hoover  moved  from  commerce  secretary  to  pres-
ident  on  March  4,  1929,  three  months  before  the  recession 
began and half a year before the 1929 stock market crash. He 
kept Andrew Mellon on as treasury secretary. Mellon had been 
nominated by Warren G. Harding and confirmed on March 9, 
1921,  five  days  after  Harding’s  term  began.  Mellon  stayed  in 
his post when Harding died of a heart attack in 1923 and was 
succeeded by Calvin Coolidge. Mellon stayed in his post when 
Coolidge won a term in his own right and was inaugurated in 
1925. Mellon stayed in his post when Hoover took over in 1929. 
Only  Albert  Gallatin—treasury  secretary  for  Jefferson,  Madi-
son,  and  Monroe—served  longer.  Tax,  budget,  and  monetary 
policy (for the treasury secretary was in those days the chair of 
the Federal Reserve Board)—all those were within Mellon’s pur-
view. Hoover was an expert mining engineer and a manager who 
believed in experts. And Mellon was his expert on how to deal  
with the Great Depression.

Looking back from the 1950s and contemplating the wreck 
of his country’s economy and his own political career, Hoover 
cursed Mellon and his supporters in his administration who had 
advised inaction during the downslide:

The “leave-it-alone liquidationists” headed by Secretary of the 
Treasury  Mellon  felt  that  government  must  keep  its  hands 
off and let the slump liquidate itself. Mr. Mellon had only 
one formula: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the 
farmers, liquidate real estate.” He held that even panic was 
not altogether a bad thing. He said: “It will purge the rotten-
ness out of the system. High costs of living and high living 
will come down. People will work harder, live a more moral 
life. Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick 
up the wrecks from less competent people.”16

In his memoirs, Hoover wrote as though he had wanted to 
pursue more activist policies: do more than simply hand out relief 
and assure people that prosperity was, if not just around the cor-
ner, nearby. Hoover wrote as though Mellon had overruled him, 
and he had no choice but to comply. But, of Hoover and Mellon, 
which of them was head of the executive branch? And which was 
merely head of one of its departments?

This ruling doctrine—that, in the long run, the Great Depres-
sion would turn out to have been good medicine for the economy, 
and that proponents of stimulative policies were shortsighted en-
emies of the public welfare—was, to put it bluntly, completely 
bats,  simply  insane.  John  Stuart  Mill  had  nailed  the  analytical 
point back in 1829: an excess demand for money was what pro-
duced a “general glut,” and if the economy’s money supply were 
matched to money demand there would be no depression.17 Prac-
tical central bankers had developed a playbook for what to do.18 
Yet it was not followed.

Why? Perhaps because in previous downturns the excess de-
mand for money had triggered a scramble for liquidity: people 
desperate  for  cash  immediately  dumped  other  assets,  including 
the government bonds they held. As government bonds fell in 
price, the interest rates they paid rose. Central bankers saw such 
sharp spikes in government bond interest rates as a signal that the 
economy needed more cash.

But the Great Depression was not like previous downturns.
In this downturn the excess demand for money was so broad 
and fear was so great that it triggered a scramble for safety. Yes, 
people  were  desperate  for  more  cash,  but  they  were  also  des-
perate for assets that they could easily turn into cash. Believing 
the troubles would last for quite a while, they dumped other as-
sets on the market—speculative stocks, industrial stocks, utility 
stocks, bonds of all kinds, even secure railroad stocks and things 
like  their  ancestors’  furniture  and  their  summer  homes.  The 
scramble  was  on  for  both  cash  and  government  bonds.  Along

with furniture left curbside, there was also no government-bond 
interest-rate spike, leaving central bankers unsure as to what was 
going on.

For  their  part,  governments  everywhere  strained  their  every 
nerve  and  muscle  to  restore  competitiveness  and  balance  their  
budgets, which meant, in practice, further depressing demand, and 
in turn reducing wages and prices. In Germany, the chancellor— 
the prime minister—Heinrich Brüning, decreed a 10 percent cut 
in prices, and a 10 to 15 percent cut in wages. But every step taken 
in pursuit of financial orthodoxy made matters worse.

When you look at interest rates during the Great Depression 
you  see  a  steadily  widening  gap  between  safe  interest  rates  on 
government securities and the interest rates that companies able 
to borrow had to pay. Even though credit, understood as liquid-
ity, was ample—in the sense that borrowers with perfect and un-
impaired collateral could obtain loans at extremely low interest 
rates—the vast majority of businesses struggling to stay afloat—
namely, businesses with imperfect, impaired collateral—found it 
next to impossible to obtain capital to finance investment, be-
cause new investment expenditures on plant and equipment were 
risky, and the financial economy was desperately short of safety.

The banking system froze up. It no longer performed its social 
function of channeling purchasing power from savers to investors. 
Private investment collapsed; falling investment produced more 
unemployment, excess capacity, further falls in prices, and more 
deflation; and further deflation rendered investors less willing to 
invest and the banking system even more insolvent, deepening 
the freeze.

The spiral of deflation would continue to depress the econ-
omy until something was done to restore solvency to the bank-
ing  system  in  a  way  that  broke  the  expectation  of  further  falls 
in prices. During the Great Depression, few economists under-
stood this process. None of them who did walked the corridors 
of power.

So  it  was  that  the  ruling  “liquidationist”  doctrine  overrode 
the anguished cries of dissent from those less hindered by their 
theoretical blinders (as well as the anguished cries of the unem-
ployed, the hungry, and the uncertainly housed, if housed at all). 
As the British monetary economist R. G. Hawtrey wrote, “Fan-
tastic fears of inflation were expressed. That was to cry, Fire, Fire, 
in Noah’s Flood.”19 The Great Depression was the twentieth cen-
tury’s greatest case of self-inflicted economic catastrophe. As John 
Maynard Keynes wrote at its very start, in 1930, the world was 
“as capable as before of affording for every one a high standard 
of life.” But the outlook was nevertheless ominous: “Today,” he 
said,  “we  have  involved  ourselves  in  a  colossal  muddle,  having 
blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of 
which we do not understand.” Keynes feared that “the slump” 
of 1930 might “pass over into a depression, accompanied by a 
sagging price level, which might last for years with untold damage 
to the material wealth and to the social stability of every country 
alike.”  He  called  for  resolute,  coordinated  monetary  expansion 
by the major industrial economies “to restore confidence in the 
international  long-term  bond  market . . . and  to  restore  [raise] 
prices and profits, so that in due course the wheels of the world’s 
commerce  would  go  round  again.”20  His  was  the  croaking  of  
a Cassandra.

But  such  action  never  emerges  from  committees,  or  from 
international meetings, unless it has been well prepared before-
hand. It emerges, rather, from the actions of a hegemon. Such is 
required  for  a  well-functioning  global  economy.  Before  World 
War I, everybody knew that Britain was the hegemon and ad-
justed their behavior to conform with the rules of the game laid 
down in London. After World War II, everyone would similarly 
know that the United States was the hegemon. America had the 
power to take effective action to shape the patterns of interna-
tional finance all by itself, had it wished. But, during the interwar 
period, it didn’t. The necessary action was not forthcoming.

The Great Depression

And so Keynes’s fears came to pass.
During World War I and after, the main belligerents, he said, 
had shaken “the delicate, complicated organization . . . through 
which  alone  the  European  peoples  can  employ  themselves  and 
live.” Broken by war, the system was shattered by the Depression. 
These powers that be, he continued, had “render[ed] impossible 
a continuation of the social and economic order of the nineteenth 
century.” And they had done so “with no plan for replacing it.” 
Keynes warned that the consequences could be dire: “Vengeance, 
I dare predict, will not limp.” And he was right. For once the 
Great Depression began, “nothing can then delay for long that 
final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing 
convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late 
German war [World War I] will fade into nothing, and which 
will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilization and progress of our 
generation.”21 Keynes was pessimistic. As it came to pass, civiliza-
tion would not be “destroyed,” but rather, “maimed.”

A large part of what made the Great Depression so painful 
was that it was not only deep, but also long. There were many 
reasons for this. Let me pick out three:

A first reason it stretched on for so long was workers’ unwill-
ingness to take risks. With so much instability, most were content 
to settle for what manner of living they could find that was most 
secure. The experience of long and high unemployment casts a 
large  and  deep  shadow  on  the  labor  market.  Risky  but  profit-
able enterprises had a difficult time attracting the workers they 
needed, and so investment remained depressed.

A second reason it was long was the memory of the gold stan-
dard and the belief that economies needed to get back to it. This 
belief dissuaded governments in the 1930s from taking many of 
the steps to boost production and employment that they other-
wise might have pursued: the gold standard was dead by 1931, 
but  its  ghost  continued  to  haunt  the  world  economy.  Few  of 
these  much-needed  measures  were  undertaken.  The  only  one

that governments did take up was currency depreciation: stim-
ulating net exports by switching demand to domestic-made and 
away from foreign-made goods. Commentators disparaged cur-
rency depreciation as “beggar-thy-neighbor.” It was. But it was 
the only thing generally undertaken that was effective.22

A third reason was that the lack of a hegemon to guide co-
ordinated action in international monetary affairs not only pre-
vented anticipatory reforms but also blocked coordinated global 
policy responses. The major monetary powers of the world passed 
up their chances to do anything constructive together. Recovery, 
where it came, was national only, not global.

In general, the sooner countries went off the gold standard, 
and the less constrained they were thereafter by the orthodoxy 
of  gold-standard  habits,  the  better  they  fared.  Thus,  the  Scan-
dinavian  countries  that  bailed  first  from  the  gold  standard  did 
best.  Japan  was  second.  Britain  also  abandoned  the  gold  stan-
dard, in 1931, but Japan embraced expansionary policies more 
thoroughly. The United States and Germany abandoned the gold 
standard in 1933, but Hitler had a clearer view that Nazi per-
sistence and success required putting people to work than FDR 
did with the try-everything-expediency of his New Deal.

But all of the opinions of the great and good blocked action 
toward “reflation,” that is, adopting policies to restore the level of 
prices and the flow of spending to pre-Depression 1929 levels. The 
consensus opinion of the powerful—the “money changers . . . in 
their  high  seats  in  the  temple  of  our  civilization,”  as  President 
Franklin Roosevelt called them in his 1933 Inaugural Address—
was that what was needed was, instead, “austerity”: sound money, 
government spending cuts, and balanced budgets.23 Those who 
proposed doing something were denounced from the right as con 
artists, for, as Churchill’s private secretary, P. J. Grigg, put it, “an 
economy could not forever by government financial legerdemain 
live beyond its means on its wits.”24

The Great Depression

The most incisive, if not the shrewdest, contemporary critic 
of Keynes, the University of Chicago’s Jacob Viner, said that such 
policies could work only if the “volume of employment, irrespec-
tive of quality, is considered important.” He added that the econ-
omy could avoid inflationary self-destruction only as long as “the 
printing press could maintain a constant lead” in an inevitable 
race with “the business agents of the trade unions.”25

Again, it is impossible not to note the history of the Great 
Depression  rhyming  with  the  history  of  the  Great  Recession. 
“Austerity” went into eclipse after World War II, but it contin-
ued to burble underground, and would resurface to vengeful and 
disastrous effect in 2008. That year saw a revival of the Schum-
peterian claim that mass unemployment was an essential part of 
the process of economic growth, and that attempts to artificially 
keep the unproductive from experiencing it would only store up 
more trouble for the future. The University of Chicago’s John 
Cochrane  claimed  in  November  2009  that  he  welcomed  the 
prospect of a recession because “people pounding nails in Nevada 
need to find something else to do”: he thought recession unem-
ployment would be a welcome spur.

Keynes snarked back. While policies of government activism 
and  reflation  certainly  violated  orthodox  canons  of  laissez-faire 
economics, the system would be judged on whether it managed 
to get people jobs. Activism and reflation were nevertheless “the 
only  practicable  means  of  avoiding  the  destruction  of  existing 
economic forms in their entirety.”26

Moreover,  Keynes  snarked  further,  if  his  critics  were  even 
half-smart, they would have understood that successful capital-
ism needed the support of an activist government ensuring full 
employment, for without that, only the lucky innovators would 
survive, and only the mad would attempt to become innovators. 
Growth would therefore be much slower than necessary: “If effec-
tive demand is deficient,” he said, the entrepreneur was “operating 

221

with  the  odds  loaded  against  him.”  The  “world’s  wealth”  had 
“fallen  short  of . . . individual  savings;  and  the  difference  has 
been made up by the losses of those whose courage and initiative 
have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good 
fortune.” Austerity and orthodoxy and laissez-faire were, in the 
conditions of the world after 1914, deadly destructive mistakes. 
And the persistence of the Great Depression, no matter how big 
the budget cuts, showed that Keynes was right.

In one region of the North Atlantic alone was the Great De-
pression shallow, short, and followed by a decade of strong eco-
nomic growth: Scandinavia. In the interwar period the socialists of 
the Scandinavian countries won enough votes to exercise power. 
In sharp contrast to their counterparts in Britain and France—
who had no idea of what a left-wing exercise of political power 
would be)—these socialists pursued housing subsidies, paid holi-
day and maternity benefits, expanded public-sector employment, 
government loans to the newly married, and the like—all made 
possible by a monetary policy that cut loose from the gold stan-
dard earlier than other countries. Thus socialists turned into so-
cial  democrats:  they  lost  their  commitment  to  the  apocalyptic 
doctrines of socialism, lost their belief that all private property 
was inherently evil, lost their belief that only a great and sudden 
revolutionary transformation could bring about a better society. 
Democracy became a goal rather than a tactic.27

Close behind Scandinavia in having a mild Great Depression 
was Japan, which abandoned fiscal orthodoxy and budget balanc-
ing in 1931. The Great Depression in Japan was not deep, and it 
was over by 1932.28 This was largely thanks to Takahashi Kore-
kiyo, not one of the “Meiji Six,” but in the next rank of Japanese 
modernizers. In 1931, at the age of seventy-two, he became min-
ister of finance for the third time, and he had little tolerance for 
European models of “sound finance.” Japan devalued its currency 
in order to boost demand by making its export industries hyper-
competitive and generating an export boom. It also embarked on

a massive program of armaments manufacturing. Industrial pro-
duction in Japan in 1936 was half again what it had been in 1928. 
This proved an effective short-run economic policy, but turned 
out to be a bad long-run strategy: the armaments boom and the 
loss of civilian control over the military led to Japan getting in-
volved in a land war in Asia, and then, ultimately, to its attacks 
on the world’s two superpowers, Britain and the United States.

Takahashi would not live to see the horrors and tragedies of 
World War II. He was one of three senior politicians who were 
assassinated on February 26, 1936, when the Imperial Way fac-
tion of the army attempted to seize power. He had not pushed the 
military budget high enough to please the coup plotters.

Elsewhere, the Great Depression was a long disaster. It was 
worst in Germany, where it brought to power Adolf Hitler—his 
mass support came not in the 1920s as a consequence of inflation 
but in the 1930s as a consequence of mass unemployment.

Once Hitler had taken power and broken adherence to mon-
etary and fiscal orthodoxy, his Nazi Germany was able to recover. 
With the Gestapo in the background, and with strong demand 
from  the  government  for  public  works  and  military  programs, 
unemployment  fell  rapidly  in  Germany  in  the  1930s.29  Hitler  
appears to have been focused on employment and weapons, not 
adding  to  industrial  capacity  and  increasing  national  wealth.  
Political effectiveness and military capacity were the priorities.30

Political effectiveness we understand. But weapons? Armies? 
Hadn’t World War I taught the Germans, and even the Nazis, 
and even Hitler, not to do that again? No, it had not.31

Overall,  the  major  monetary  powers  of  the  world  regularly 
passed  up  their  chances  to  do  something  constructive  and  co-
ordinated to help the world monetary system recover. In 1933, 
the last chance, the London Economic Conference, collapsed in 
disagreement. The French believed they should try to maintain 
the gold standard. The British, who had long since abandoned it, 
were unwilling to, in economist Barry J. Eichengreen’s words, “tie

their policies to those of a foreign partner [the United States] of 
whose intentions they were unsure.”32 Coordinated reflation was 
the first obvious strategy. But it was never tried. Fiscal expansion 
was the next obvious thing to try. But it was not attempted until 
the very end of the decade, when the threat of war made govern-
ments realize that spending public money to build weapons was 
more important than trying, yet again, to balance the budget.33

Close  to  bringing  up  the  rear  in  the  race  for  recovery  was 
Britain. Great Britain had been forced off the gold standard in 
September 1931. But its abandonment of the gold standard was 
not followed by large-scale reflation. The Bank of England did its 
part, cutting back on its short-term discount rate. The National- 
Conservative government, however, did not do its part. In Octo-
ber, the Conservative Party swept the general election, winning 
78 percent of seats in the House of Commons. Britain’s recovery 
from the Great Depression would be slow and painful.34

France, which stuck it out on the gold standard until 1937, 
did worst of all. Its undervalued exchange rate parity chosen after 
its sevenfold inflation in the 1920s made France, temporarily, an 
export powerhouse. So when the Great Depression began, it had 
little effect on France at first. But as exports dropped, country 
after country devalued to try to regain some foreign demand. In-
creasingly, countries that had not devalued found their industries 
uncompetitive, their payments in deficit, and their maintenance 
of  convertibility  a  source  of  domestic  unemployment,  because 
they had to maintain higher interest rates and apply further de-
flation  to  keep  foreign  exchange  speculators’  greed  in  balance 
with their fear. A fragmented electorate produced unstable coa-
lition governments. From the crash of 1929 to 1936, the French 
prime ministers were, in succession, Aristide Briand, André Tar-
dieu, Camille Chautemps, Tardieu again, Théodore Steeg, Pierre  
Laval, Tardieu yet again, Édouard Herriot, Joseph Paul-Boncour, 
Édouard  Daladier,  Albert  Sarraut,  Chautemps  again,  Daladier

France and the other holdouts—the Netherlands, Switzerland—
abandoned their gold parity in 1936.35

Blum promised to restore pensions and public-sector wages 
to where they had been before the budget cuts. He also promised 
to greatly increase unemployment benefits, to defend the franc, 
to balance the budget, to cut back on military spending, and to 
share the work and the wealth by cutting back on working hours 
and supporting strikes.
It did not add up.
Blum abandoned the gold standard. But that did not mean 
substantial expansion of aggregate demand: the government’s be-
lief that the government should be trying to balance the budget 
led it to scale back its non-military spending programs. The in-
vesting  public’s  fear  of  socialism  more  than  offset  the  positive, 
stimulative effects of a late devaluation. France entered 1938, the 
last year before the beginning of World War II in Europe, with its 
level of industrial production still less than it had been in 1929.

That the Great Depression was long meant that the reaction 
to  it  shaped  countries’  politics  and  societies  for  a  long  time  to 
come. George Orwell was one of the most eloquent in express-
ing how the system that had produced the Great Depression had 
failed humanity: “The thing that horriﬁed and amazed me was 
to ﬁnd that many were ashamed of being unemployed. I was very 
ignorant, but not so ignorant as to imagine that when the loss of 
foreign markets pushes two million men out of work, those two 
million are any more to blame than the people who draw blanks 
in the Calcutta Sweep.”36

But once unemployment is no longer seen as the fault of the 
unemployed, any belief that the unpleasantness of work is the re-
sult of personal responsibility becomes vulnerable as well. And so

someone like Orwell could reframe coal miners not as unskilled 
workers with a union who were probably overpaid, but as bene-
factors whom the rest of us had not properly acknowledged:

Practically everything we do, from eating an ice to crossing 
the Atlantic, and from baking a loaf to writing a novel, in-
volves the use of coal. . . . It is only because miners sweat their 
guts out that superior persons can remain superior. You and 
I and the editor of the Times Lit. Supp., and the Nancy Poets 
and the Archbishop of Canterbury and Comrade X, author 
of Marxism for Infants—all of us really owe the comparative 
decency of our lives to poor drudges underground, blackened 
to the eyes, with their throats full of coal dust, driving their 
shovels forward with arms and belly muscles of steel.37

Orwell’s touchstone for judging a social system was a combi-
nation of honesty, decency, prosperity, and liberty, but with the 
accent on decency. The social and economic system had a moral 
obligation to treat these men well. It was not decent that they 
should be without work. And since the system did not live up to 
the obligations it had undertaken, it did not deserve to.

With the coming of the Depression, it was impossible not 
to conclude that the old order was bankrupt. And as it fell, it 
took representative democracy down with it. By 1939, represen-
tative democracy was to be found only in Great Britain and its 
Dominions,  in  the  United  States,  in  France,  and  in  an  arc  of 
small  northwestern  European  countries:  Switzerland,  Luxem-
bourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, 
and Finland.

IN  SCANDINAVIA,  THE  SUCCESS  of  social  democratic  parties 
in navigating through the Great Depression would put them in

power for the succeeding half-century. In much of continental 
Europe, the Depression reinforced reaction—which is to say, it 
reinforced the sense that Mussolini in Italy had it right, and that 
fascism was the way of the future and the best way to organize 
industrial societies. Thus, one of the gifts that the Great Depres-
sion gave the world was the victory in the Spanish Civil War of 
the 1930s of the man who became one of the world’s longest- 
living fascist dictators, Generalissimo Francisco Franco. A second 
such gift was Germany’s Adolf Hitler. Where it did not reinforce 
reaction, the Depression reinforced allegiance to the belief that 
the old system was irremediably broken and that a revolutionary 
change was needed—perhaps one based on people’s fantasies of 
what was then going on in that part of the world ruled absolutely 
by Joseph Stalin from Moscow’s Kremlin.

More  important  than  that  the  United  States  was  going  to 
be  a  laggard  in  recovery  from  the  Great  Depression  was  that 
the United States, under left-of-center Franklin Roosevelt, who 
was elected president in a landslide at the end of 1932, did learn 
this first principal rule about recovery—spend money and buy 
things—and  then  applied  it.  Roosevelt’s  policies  worked  well 
enough to gain him durable majority support.

That  was  enormously  consequential.  First,  he  was  willing 
enough to break political norms that he is the only US president 
to have been elected four times. He ruled for twelve years, and his 
designated successor, Harry S Truman, for eight. Second, he was 
a conservative radical: he wanted to save what was good about 
America by throwing overboard everything that he saw as block-
ing it.

Before the 1930s, US presidential candidates had simply not 
appeared at the national political conventions. Candidates were 
supposed to remain at their homes, tending to their private af-
fairs, until party officials informed them (a week or so after the 
convention) that they had been chosen. They were supposed to

emulate the Roman politician Cincinnatus, who mythically re-
mained on his small farm plowing his fields until he was told that 
he had been elected commander-in-chief of the Roman army and 
dictator of Rome. The conventional pretense was that the man 
did not seek the office: the office sought the man.

But in 1932, Roosevelt, who was then governor of New York, 
broke  tradition  and  flew  to  Chicago—in  part,  historian  Frank 
Leuchtenburg says, to disprove whispers that a polio victim with 
paralyzed legs was too frail to undertake a full-scale presidential 
campaign. Roosevelt spoke to the delegates:

I have started out . . . by breaking the absurd traditions that 
the candidate should remain in professed ignorance of what 
has happened for weeks. . . .

. . . You have nominated me and I know it, and I am here 

to thank you for the honor.

. . . In so doing I broke traditions. Let it be from now on 

the task of our Party to break foolish traditions. . . .

. . .
I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a New Deal for the Amer-

ican people.38

And, indeed, the cards were thrown into the center, picked 
up,  and  redealt.  Franklin  Roosevelt  meant  what  he  said  about 
a  “New  Deal.”  In  the  United  States,  by  striking  contrast  with 
so much else of the global north, the Great Depression did not 
empower reaction, but rather far-reaching liberal and social dem-
ocratic experimentation.

This is somewhat of a surprise: Why did the Great Depres-
sion not push the United States to the right, into reaction, or 
proto-fascism, or fascism, as it did in so many other countries, 
but  instead  to  the  left?  My  guess  is  that  it  was  sheer  luck— 
Herbert Hoover and the Republicans were in power when the

The Great Depression

Great  Depression  started,  and  they  were  thrown  out  of  office 
in  1932.  That  Franklin  Roosevelt  was  center-left  rather  than 
center- right, that the length of the Great Depression meant that 
institutions were shaped by it in a durable sense, and that the 
United States was the world’s rising superpower, and the only 
major power not crippled to some degree by World War II—all 
these factors made a huge difference. After World War II, the 
United  States  had  the  power  and  the  will  to  shape  the  world 
outside the Iron Curtain. It did so. And that meant much of the 
world was to be reshaped in a New Deal rather than a reaction-
ary or fascist mode.

Usually US politics is the politics of near-gridlock. The elec-
tions of the 1930s would be different. Roosevelt won 59 percent 
of the vote in 1932—an 18 percentage-point margin over Her-
bert Hoover. Congress swung heavily Democratic in both houses. 
To an extent not seen since the Civil War, the president and his 
party had unshakable working majorities. But Roosevelt had little 
idea what he was going to do. He did have a conviction that he 
could do something important. And he was certain that Herbert 
Hoover had gotten pretty much everything wrong. What Hoover 
had  been  doing  was  blocking  attempts  to  start  employment- 
promoting public works, acting aggressively to balance the bud-
get, raising tariffs, and maintaining the gold standard. Roosevelt 
decided to do the opposite. What else? If you had a half-plausible 
thing, you had a good chance of persuading Roosevelt to try to 
do it. After trying it, he would take a look, and then drop and 
abandon things that did not seem to be working, while pushing 
hard the things that did.

The First New Deal was therefore made up of many things: a 
strong “corporatist” program of joint government-industry plan-
ning, collusive regulation, and cooperation; the entire farm sector 
on the federal dole indefinitely, with strong regulation of com-
modity prices; a program of building and operating utilities; huge

amounts of public works spending; meaningful federal regulation 
of financial markets; insurance for small depositors’ bank depos-
its; mortgage relief; unemployment relief; plus promises to lower 
tariffs, lower working hours, and raise wages.39

Some of it was very good indeed: the devaluation of the dol-
lar and the shock effect of the National Industry Recovery Act 
(NIRA)  of  1933  did  break  the  back  of  expectations  of  future 
deflation.  The  creation  of  deposit  insurance  and  the  reform  of 
the banking system did make savers willing to trust their money 
to  the  banks  again,  and  began  the  re-expansion  of  the  money 
supply.  Corporatism  and  farm  subsidies  did  spread  the  pain. 
Taking budget balancing off the agenda helped. Promising un-
employment and mortgage relief helped. Promising public works 
spending helped. All these policy moves kept things from getting 
worse. They certainly made things somewhat better. And things 
became substantially better immediately. But aside from devalua-
tion, monetary expansion, and an end to expectations of deflation 
and pressure for more fiscal contraction, what was the effect of 
Roosevelt’s “Hundred Days”? It is not clear whether the balance 
sheet of the rest of the First New Deal was positive or negative. 
Certainly it did not bring complete recovery.

Therefore Roosevelt kept trying. He launched a Second New 

Deal.

The Roosevelt lieutenant who had the most influence on the 
Second New Deal—for once again Roosevelt was calling for bold 
action, but did not have very strong prior beliefs about the di-
rection that action should take—was his labor secretary, Frances 
Perkins. Despite the burdens she carried—being the first-ever fe-
male US cabinet member; caring for her frequently hospitalized 
bipolar husband, Paul Wilson; being distrusted by both unions 
and managers for not being fully on their respective sides; and 
being  denounced  by  the  right  for  being  a  communist,  because 
she  did  everything  she  could  to  delay  and  block  deportation

proceedings against communist West Coast longshoreman union 
leader Harry Bridges—she served for twelve years in the post and 
was one of the most effective cabinet members ever.

The most enduring and powerful accomplishment of the Sec-
ond New Deal was to be her Social Security Act, which provided 
federal  cash  assistance  for  widows,  orphans,  children  without 
fathers in the home, and the disabled, and which also set up a 
near-universal system of federally funded old-age pensions. And if 
pushing up the dollar price of gold did not work well enough, per-
haps strengthening the union movement would: the Wagner Act 
of 1935, which set down a new set of rules for labor- management 
conflict,  massively  strengthened  the  union  movement,  so  that 
large-scale private unionization in the United States survived for 
half a century after the 1930s. In the end, the programs of the 
Second New Deal probably did little to cure the Great Depres-
sion in the United States. But they did turn the United States 
into a modest European-style social democracy.

The  New  Deal  Order—with  its  near-total  rejection  of  the 
idea of laissez-faire—lasted. Truth be told, laissez-faire had never 
been  economists’  consensus:  it  was,  rather,  what  other  people 
thought and wrote that governments had applied and economists 
had taught. Nevertheless, it had been a very powerful doctrine—
up until and then well into the Great Depression.

But afterward, for a while, laissez-faire and its cousin, “aus-
terity,”  were  greatly  diminished.  The  US  economy  did  recover 
from the nadir of 1933 under Roosevelt’s New Deal, albeit in-
completely. By 1941, 82 percent of US households had a radio; 
63 percent had a refrigerator; 55 percent had an automobile; and 
49 percent had a vacuum cleaner. Nobody had had any of these 
back in 1914.40

It  was,  in  the  1950s,  a  Republican,  President  Dwight  D.  
Eisenhower, who wrote, in a letter to his brother Edgar, that the 
workings  of  the  market  should  not  be  accepted  as  in  any  way

“blessed,” that laissez-faire was (or ought to be) dead, and that 
attempts to resurrect it were simply “stupid”:

The Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibil-
ities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be 
undertaken by it. . . . If a rule of reason is not applied in this 
effort, we will lose everything—even to a possible and drastic 
change in the Constitution. This is what I mean by my con-
stant insistence upon “moderation” in government. Should 
any political party attempt to abolish social security, unem-
ployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm pro-
grams, you would not hear of that party again in our political 
history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes 
you can do these things. . . . Their number is negligible and 
they are stupid.41

In  1930,  as  the  Great  Depression  started,  John  Maynard 
Keynes distracted an audience one evening with a talk on “Eco-
nomic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren.” Suppose the prob-
lems of managing the economy to maintain full employment; of 
providing  incentives  for  technological  discovery,  development, 
and deployment; of providing incentives for savings and invest-
ment; and of keeping people confident that society was working, 
in the sense that equals were not being treated too unequally and 
that unequals were not being treated too equally, could be solved. 
What,  then,  would  be  the  economic  problems—or  rather  pos-
sibilities—for  humanity,  or  at  least  for  the  global  north,  come 
2030?

Keynes’s  conclusion  was  that  science  and  technology  and 
compound interest would within a century deliver sufficient ma-
terial abundance that “the economic problem” would prove not 
to  be  “the  permanent  problem  of  the  human  race.”  Although 
“the struggle for subsistence” had “always . . . been hitherto the

primary, most pressing problem,” once the economic problems 
were solved humankind would “be deprived of its traditional pur-
pose,” and instead would face the “real, . . . permanent problem—
how to use . . . freedom from pressing economic cares . . . to live 
wisely and agreeably and well.”42

That was indeed a very hopeful and entrancing vision. Even 
in the distress of the arriving Great Depression, Keynes saw an 
end to the tunnel and much light there.

Really-Existing Socialism

T o most living through it, the Great Depression reinforced a 

conviction that had been building since the shock of World 
War I, or perhaps even earlier—a growing sense that both the 
global economic order and individual countries’ political orders 
had failed. They had failed to restore the rapid upward march of 
prosperity. They had failed to provide a land fit for heroes. They 
had failed to generate a stable and high level of employment. And 
by the Depression’s midpoint, the political-economic orders had 
clearly failed to vindicate citizens’ Polanyian rights.

They  had  manifestly  failed  to  provide  people  with  a  secure 
place in a stable community. They had failed to provide them with 
a sense of job security. They had failed patently to ensure incomes 
that corresponded to what individuals felt that they deserved. The 
political-economic  orders  had  even  failed  to  provide  the  rights  
that a market society is supposed to protect above all: that owner-
ship of property gives you security, prosperity, and power.

Rather, the opposite seemed true. The Great Depression had 
demonstrated that even property rights can become strained in a 
dysfunctional economy. The political insurgencies of the postwar 
years had demonstrated that property rights themselves could be 
up for grabs. And the coming of truly mass politics—reinforced 
by  radio  and  the  gutter  press—had  shown  that  deference  to

secure, prosperous elites and respect for authority were in tatters, 
along with the formation of societal consensus. In short, the old 
system did not work.

What was this old system, this Old Order—this thing that had 
managed the explosion of economic growth and the expansion 
of human freedom from 1870 to 1914? It was, at best, pseudo- 
classical, for it was not old and time honored but rather newly 
invented by those who had held power over society before 1870, 
who wanted to continue to hold it, and who recognized that, as 
Prince Tancredi Falconeri, the nephew of the Prince of Salina, 
says in Lampedusa’s novel Il Gattopardo: “If we want things to 
stay as they are, things will have to change! Do you understand?”1
It was only semi-liberal, for pressure to allow market forces a 
freer rein was resisted, and every “liberalization” of economic life 
from regulation was a brutal, prolonged, and only half-won strug-
gle if such a change would adversely affect the wealth of the rich 
and the noble. Yes, there was pressure to judge people as equals 
differing only by the weight of their purses, but what this meant 
was that wealth could gain you entry into a hierarchical elite of 
social networks and superior status.

This  pseudo-classical  semi-liberalism  remained  an  ideal  for 
many in the 1920s and for a few well into the 1930s. Rolling 
back the changes of the World War I era and the Great Depres-
sion, and returning to this Old Order, was the express desire of 
a  large  but  waning  political  and  governmental  coalition  in  the 
global north. To his last day in office, Herbert Hoover kept try-
ing to bind his successor to balancing the budget and maintaining 
the gold standard.

But by the middle of the 1930s, the numbers and confidence 
of those who were committed to rollback had dwindled to very 
few indeed. In the middle of the Great Depression, few believed 
that liberalizing markets could deliver enough economic growth 
and enough redistribution to keep society’s most powerful groups 
from concluding that it was time to overthrow the political game

board. Better, in the view of many, to get in on the winning side 
than to go down supporting attempts to reconstruct a system that 
manifestly did not work.

What  were  the  alternatives?  There  was,  on  the  one  hand, 
fascism— freshly  coined  from  the  brains  of  its  inventors—and, 
on  the  other,  socialism—distantly  descended  from  the  idea  of 
Marx, Engels, and company. Fascism was something visible and 
tangible: by its fruits you could judge it. Socialism, however, was 
the interpretation of a dream. All agreed that the reality as imple-
mented on the ground fell vastly short of what ought to be—and 
what someday might be.

Lenin’s  regime  was  the  first  seizure  of  power  by  latter-day 
disciples of Marx who were eager to bring Marx’s dream king-
dom down to earth: really-existing socialism, implemented via 
something called the “dictatorship of the proletariat.” That first 
word,  “dictatorship,”  meant,  for  the  phrase’s  coiner,  Joseph 
Weydemeyer— as it meant for Marx and Engels—the temporary 
suspension of checks and balances, procedural impediments, and 
established powers, so the government could make the needed 
changes and actually govern—violently, when necessary, to over-
come reactionary opposition.2 Originally it meant the same non-
permanent thing for Lenin.3

But in whose interest would it govern?
In Lenin’s mind, that concentrated power would be admin-
istered  for  the  proletariat.  Why  not  just  have  a  dictatorship  of 
the people—a democracy? Because, Lenin believed, all society’s 
non-proletariat  classes  had  selfish  interests.  To  allow  them  any 
political power during the initial post-revolutionary dictatorship 
would only retard the inevitable progress of history. Which was 
toward utopia. Which was true socialism.

I  trust  I  give  little  away  when  I  tell  you,  really-existing  so-
cialism  was,  in  the  hands  of  its  disciples,  to  become  the  most 
murderous of the totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century. 
Admitting this now can, and should, help focus our attention.

Until it really existed, “socialism” could mean many things—
things other than the system Lenin created and Stalin solidified. 
In Western Europe and North America during the World War I 
era, most who called themselves any flavor of “socialist” held that 
in a good society there ought to be enormous scope for individ-
ual initiative, for diversity, for the decentralization of decision- 
making, for liberal values, and even for non- commanding-heights 
private property. True freedom was, after all, the point. Elimi-
nating the unequal distribution of income under capitalism that 
kept the bulk of the formerly free imprisoned in the same life of 
drudgery and imprisonment was the goal.

In price regulation and in public ownership, the question was 
an empirical one: private where private belongs, public where it 
was needed. And most people trusted representative democracy 
and  rational  argument  to  settle  things  case  by  case.  But  others 
took a more radical view, pushing for something beyond even a 
reformed, well-managed, and gentler market economy. It wasn’t 
until Lenin began to exercise power that people began to discover 
the tradeoffs that would be involved in a really-existing socialism 
focused on destroying the power of the market.

Lenin, his followers, and his successors began with a general 
article of faith: Karl Marx was right. In everything. If properly 
interpreted.

Marx had mocked the sober businessmen of his time. They 
claimed  to  view  revolution  with  horror.  Yet,  Marx  asserted,  
they were themselves, in a sense, the most ruthless revolution-
aries the world had ever seen. The business class—what Marx 
called the bourgeoisie—was responsible for the (up to then) great-
est of all revolutions, and that revolution had changed the hu-
man condition. For the better. After all, it was the business class 
of entrepreneurs and investors, together with the market econ-
omy that pitted them against one another, that was responsible 
for bringing an end to the scarcity, want, and oppression that 
had been human destiny heretofore.

But Marx also saw an inescapable danger: the economic sys-
tem  that  the  bourgeoisie  had  created  would  inevitably  become 
the main obstacle to human happiness. It could, Marx thought, 
create wealth, but it could not distribute wealth evenly. Alongside 
prosperity would inevitably come increasing disparities of wealth. 
The rich would become richer. The poor would become poorer, 
and they would be kept in a poverty made all the more unbear-
able for being needless. The only solution was to utterly destroy 
the power of the market system to boss people around.

My use of “inescapable” and “inevitable” is not for dramatic 
effect. Inevitability was for Marx and the inheritors of his ideas 
the fix to a fatal flaw. Marx spent his entire life trying to make 
his argument simple, comprehensible, and watertight. He failed. 
He failed because he was wrong. It is simply not the case that 
market economies necessarily produce ever-rising inequality and 
ever- increasing immiseration in the company of ever-increasing 
wealth. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they do not. And whether 
they do or do not is within the control of the government, which 
has sufficiently powerful tools to narrow and widen the income 
and wealth distribution to fit its purposes.

But  utopian,  and  for  that  matter  dystopian,  thinking  does 
poorly with sometimes this and sometimes that, better or worse 
outcomes dependent on governments and their decisions. Inevita-
ble was the patch for the flaw of contingent uncertainty. So Marx 
decided  to  prove  that  the  existing  system  guaranteed  dystopia: 
“The more productive capital grows, the more the division of la-
bor and the application of machinery expands. The more the divi-
sion of labor and the application of machinery expands, the more 
competition among the workers expands and the more their wages  
contract.  The  forest  of  uplifted  arms  demanding  work  becomes 
thicker  and  thicker,  while  the  arms  themselves  become  thinner 
and  thinner.”4  Marx  was  also  certain  that  his  dystopian  vision 
of late capitalism would not be the end state of human history. 
For this bleak capitalist system was to be overthrown by one that

nationalized and socialized the means of production. The rule of 
the business class, after creating a truly prosperous society, would 
“produce . . . above all . . . its own gravediggers.”

What would society be like after the revolution? Instead of pri-
vate property, there would be “individual property based on . . .  
cooperation and the possession in common of the land and of the 
means of production.” And this would happen easily, for social-
ist revolution would simply require “the expropriation of a few 
usurpers by the mass of the people,” who would then democrati-
cally decide upon a common plan for “extension of factories and 
instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into 
cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil gener-
ally.” Voilà, utopia.5

Except, of course, Marx was wrong.
This  inequality-increasing  immiseration-inevitable  socialist 
revolution simply did not happen. For one thing, immiseration 
did not happen, in Britain at least, beyond 1850. Inequality had 
increased up to a peak of 1914 in Western Europe and 1929 in 
North America. But the upward leap in economic growth after 
1870 meant that working classes all over the globe were also be-
coming richer and richer than their predecessors.

That Marx got it wrong is not surprising. The fact is he was 
a theorist with only one example of industrialization to draw on, 
Britain. And in Britain, large and visible sections of the working 
class were worse off in 1840 than in 1790. Technological unem-
ployment was a powerful thing. The construction of dark satanic 
mills in Lancashire left rural weaving skills useless, and popula-
tions impoverished. There was a window of time when some of, 
even much of, Marx’s dark brooding seemed plausible. In 1848 
the  belief  that  market  capitalism  necessarily  produced  a  distri-
bution of income that was unbearable was not reasonable.6 By 
1883, when Marx died, such a belief was indefensible. By 1914, 
the doctrine of inevitable immiseration was indeed a doctrine: a 
matter not of human reason, but of pure transcendent faith alone.

But if Marx was so wrong, why, then, spill so much ink on 
him? Because he became a prophet, and his writings became the 
sacred texts of a Major World Religion. It is hard (for me, at least) 
to read the Marx without being reminded of the Great Voice heard 
by John the Theologian, inspired by the magic mushrooms of the 
Island of Patmos, saying, “I shall wipe away all tears from their 
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, 
neither  shall  there  be  any  more  pain:  for  the  former  things  are 
passed away.” Socialism after the revolution was supposed to be 
Heaven here and now: the New Jerusalem brought down to earth.
Among Marx’s adherents were a small cadre of individuals, 
including  Lenin,  Leon  Trotsky,  and  Joseph  Stalin.  There  were 
others—rounding  out  the  Soviet  Union’s  first  Politburo  were 
Lev Kamenev and Nikolai Krestinsky—but it is a small enough 
group that it is plausible to wonder what would have happened if 
different people with differing characters and different views had 
shaken out on top. They didn’t, and perhaps it was because these 
men were not just scholars and journalists, not just the inept and 
hopeful, but also sufficiently capable, timely, and ruthless.

Lenin  and  his  successors,  all  the  way  down  to  1990,  took  
the doctrines of Marx the prophet seriously. And they tried to 
make them real. But they were not gods. While they said, “Let 
there  be  true  socialism,”  what  they  made  was,  instead,  really- 
existing socialism. It was socialism in that it claimed to have got-
ten as close to the hopes of Marx and other socialists as could 
be realized— but it was also enacted in reality, on the ground, 
in  regimes  that  at  their  peak  ruled  perhaps  one-third  of  the 
world’s  population.  It  was  not  an  intellectual  utopian  fantasy, 
but  a  necessary  compromise  with  the  messiness  of  this  world. 
Really- existing socialism was, its propagandists and apparatchiks 
claimed, as close to utopia as it was possible to get.

Throughout  most  of  really-existing  socialism’s  career,  Marx 
would  probably  have  regarded  it  with  dismay  and  perhaps  
disdain—a  frequent  fate  of  prophets.  To  really  exist,  socialism

had to depart in significant ways from the predictions (and the 
instructions) of the prophet. For, it turns out, not only do you 
have to break eggs to make an omelet, but the omelet you end 
up  making—indeed,  whether  what  you  make  can  be  called  an 
omelet at all—depends a good bit on the eggs you have at hand. 
This matters, because Russia in the early twentieth century was 
not where any of the early theorists of what became really-existing 
socialism ever thought socialism would first really exist. And for 
good reason.

In 1914, Russia was perhaps half as rich as the United States, 
and two-thirds as rich as Germany, and more unequal than both: 
figure $4 a day as a typical standard of living. Life expectancy at 
birth was barely thirty years at a time when in Western Europe 
it was fifty, and in the United States fifty-five. Russia’s wealthy, 
educated  classes  were  dominated  by  aristocratic  landlords  who 
had no functional societal role. The feudal rules of lordship and 
vassalage governed the vast majority, rather than those of private 
property, proletariat, and bourgeoisie.

While sharing little of the Industrial Revolution of the West, 
Russia  did  absorb  Western  ideas  about  equality  before  the  law, 
governments  deriving  their  just  powers  from  the  consent  of  the 
governed, and meritocracy and the end of caste-status privileges. 
These had been flowing into Russia through St. Petersburg, the 
window on the West and the Baltic Sea port capital that Peter the 
Great  had  built  centuries  before.  Included  in  this  flow  of  ideas  
were those of Marx and Engels.

In February 1917 the czar fell. In October the provisional gov-
ernment  was  overthrown  in  Lenin’s  coup.  In  December  Lenin 
dissolved the constituent assembly that was to write a democratic 
constitution. That left the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 
and its political bureau in charge. And being in charge was their only 
asset. As British historian Eric Hobsbawm has written: “Lenin rec-
ognized [that] . . . all it had going for it was the fact that it was . . .  
the established government of the country. It had nothing else.”7

A brutal civil war followed. It involved “White” supporters of 
the  czar;  local  autocrats  seeking  effective  independence;  Lenin’s 
“Red” followers; and stray other forces—including Japanese reg-
iments,  an  American  expeditionary  force,  and  a  Czech  army  of 
ex-prisoners of war that for a while found itself effectively in charge 
of Siberia. For three years the contestants, mostly White and Red—
fought back and forth over much of Russia.

To stay in this fight, and to have any hope of prevailing, the 
communist government needed to draw on the skills of the old 
czarist army officers. But could they be trusted? Leon Trotsky, 
commissar for war, came up with the answer: draft the officers, 
and shadow each one with an ideologically pure political com-
missar, who needed to sign each order and would indoctrinate 
the  soldiers  in  socialism.  This  system  of  “dual  administration” 
could be—and was—applied to everything. It was the origin of 
the pattern of administration that was to be common throughout 
Soviet society: the party watches over the technocrats to ensure 
their obedience (at least to the formulas of communist rule). And 
if the technocrats do not behave, the Gulag awaits.8

The ﬁrst imperative Lenin’s regime faced was survival. But the 
first imperative the regime thought it faced was the elimination of 
capitalism by way of nationalizing private property and removing 
business owners from management. How, though, do you run 
industry and economic life in the absence of business owners—in 
the absence of people whose incomes and social standing depend 
directly on the prosperity of individual enterprises, and who have 
the incentives and the power to try to make and keep individual 
pieces of the economy productive and functioning? Lenin’s an-
swer was that you organize the economy like an army: top down, 
planned, hierarchical, with under managers promoted, fired, or 
shot depending on how well they attained the missions that the 
high economic command assigned them.

It was against the desperate background of the Russian Civil 
War that Lenin attempted “war communism,” an effort to match

the degree of military mobilization of the economy that he be-
lieved World War I–era Germany had attained.

Lenin had been impressed by what he saw of the German cen-
trally directed war economy. He judged that the war had shown 
that  capitalism  had  “fully  matured  for  the  transition  to  social-
ism.” If Germany could “direct the economic life of 66 million 
people from a single, central institution,” then the “nonproper-
tied masses” could do something similar if they were “directed by 
the class-conscious workers”: “Expropriate the banks and, relying 
on the masses, carry out in their interests the very same thing” the 
German wartime machine was doing.9 But how did this work, ex-
actly? How could you run an economy without private property 
and without a market economy?

The World War I–era German war economy, as run by Wal-
ther Rathenau and company in the War Ministry’s Raw Materials 
Section, started with the government selling bonds or printing 
money and buying things it needed for the war effort at whatever 
prices  the  market  demanded.  This  pleased  producers:  they  got 
profits.

As prices rose and as worries about debt financing burdens 
grew, the German government began to impose price controls: 
we will pay you what we paid you last month, but no more. But 
then materials that the government wanted to buy began to be 
diverted to the civilian economy. So the German government 
imposed rationing. It prohibited the use of “strategic” materials 
for  non-military  or  non-priority  products  and  began  keeping 
track of material balances. Analysts matched production capa-
bilities to uses, with the money flows for purchases becoming 
simply  an  accounting  device,  and  then  had  the  planning  au-
thorities decide which military uses certain materials should go 
toward.

In Germany, war materiel, especially ammunition, especially 
explosives—which  meant  nitrogen  compounds—were  the  first 
to  come  under  the  aegis  of  government  planning.  Foodstuffs

followed. War expenditures rose from one-sixth of the national 
income to two-thirds. Soon, the government was not just man-
aging the movement of key raw materials to and through the fac-
tories, and then off to the front in the form of finished products, 
but also commanding that factories be expanded and built to pro-
vide for additional war production.

So it was that Germany of World War I became an inspira-

tion for war communism in the Soviet Union.

War communism in the Soviet Union started with the gov-
ernment  nationalizing  industries;  it  next  commanded  that  the 
nationalized  industries  be  supplied  with  raw  materials  at  fixed 
prices; and then it started rationing the use of scarce materials for 
non-priority projects. And with that, the Soviet Union’s centrally 
planned  economy  was  launched.  A  few  key  commodities  were 
controlled by material balances from the center, demands were 
issued to factory managers from the center, and the factory man-
agers then had to make do—beg, borrow, barter, buy, and steal 
the resources over and above those directed to them to fulfill as 
much of the plan as possible. It was highly inefficient.

It was also highly corrupt. But it did focus attention on pro-
ducing those commodities on which the center placed the highest 
priority and to which, via material balances, it devoted the key 
resources.

War  communism  was  an  agricultural  disaster—the  ﬁrst  of 
many. The do-it-yourself redistribution of land that the peasants 
accomplished (and the Bolshevik Party blessed) was very popular. 
But  the  government  needed  food  for  cities  and  towns,  and,  it 
turned out, peasant farmers living in the countryside were much 
less interested in delivering grain in exchange for urban luxuries 
than  the  now  deposed  or  dead  noble  landlords  had  been.  The 
government tried to requisition food. The peasants hid the grain. 
Hungry urban workers returned to their relatives’ family farms, 
where they could get fed. Urban factories struggled with the re-
maining underfed workers.

It may have been inefficient, corrupt, and even disastrous, yet 
war  communism  managed  to  produce  and  control  enough  re-
sources—and the Leon Trotsky–led Red Army managed to find 
enough  weapons  and  win  enough  battles—that  the  Bolsheviks 
won the Russian Civil War.

Individual  people  at  particular  places  of  decision-making 

proved influential.

Lenin and the communists won the Civil War in part because 
of Trotsky’s skill at organizing the Red Army; in part because, al-
though the peasants hated the Reds (who confiscated their grain), 
they hated the Whites (who would bring back the landlords) even 
more; and in part because of Feliks Dzerzhinsky’s skill at organiz-
ing the secret police. Finally, the communists won because during 
the Civil War their party adopted a ruthlessness that would be 
exercised not only against society at large but also against activists 
within the party itself. A “command economy” turned out to re-
quire a “command polity.”

Lenin was uniquely suited to enacting this ethos of ruthless-
ness. The writer Maxim Gorky reported him to have said that he 
liked Beethoven’s music, especially the Appassionata Sonata: “I’d 
like to listen to it every day. . . . What marvelous things human 
beings can do!” However, music “makes you want to say stupid 
nice things, and stroke the heads of people who could create such 
beauty while living in this vile hell. And now you must not stroke 
anyone’s head: you might get your hand bitten off. You have to 
strike them on the head, without any mercy, although our ideal 
is not to use force against anyone. Hm, hm, our duty is infernally 
hard.”10

Perhaps 10 million out of the 165 million people in the Rus-
sian Empire died during the Russian Civil War: roughly 1 million 
Red soldiers, 2 million White ones, and 7 million civilians. These 
casualties  were  on  top  of  the  perhaps  7  million  dead  from  the 
Spanish flu, 2 million dead from World War I, and 100,000 dead 
from the Russo-Polish War. By 1921, Russian levels of prosperity

had  fallen  by  two-thirds,  industrial  production  was  down  by 
four-fifths, and life expectancy was down to twenty. Additionally, 
a large chunk of what had been the western fringe of the czarist 
empire had broken off. A great many of the czarist generals and 
officers were dead or in exile. And any liberal democratic or so-
cial democratic center had been purged, by both the Whites and 
the Reds. The bulk of the pre–World War I czarist empire was  
now Lenin’s, becoming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 
or USSR.

The relatively small group of socialist agitators that had gath-
ered  under  Lenin’s  banner  before  the  revolution  and  cut  their 
teeth during the years of civil war now found itself with the prob-
lem of running a country and building a utopia by way of real-
ly-existing socialism.

They began the task with a faith-based expectation of help. 
Because the Marxist-Engelsian sciences of dialectical and histori-
cal materialism had told them so, Lenin and his comrades confi-
dently expected their revolution in Russia to be followed by other, 
similar communist revolutions in the more advanced, industrial 
countries of Western Europe. Once they were communist, they 
believed,  these  countries  would  provide  aid  to  poor,  agrarian 
Russia, and so make it possible for Lenin to stay in power as he 
guided  his  country  to  a  stage  of  industrial  development  where 
socialism might function the way Marx had promised it would. 
Lenin  pinned  his  hopes  on  the  most  industrialized  country  in 
Europe, with the largest and most active socialist political party: 
Germany.

A communist republic briefly held power in Hungary. An-
other one briefly held power in Bavaria, in southern Germany. 
But, in the end, the Russian Revolution was the only one that 
stuck. Really-existing socialism at the end of World War I found 
itself  under  the  leadership  of  Vladimir  Lenin  and  confined  to 
one country—albeit a very large country—in which few had ever 
imagined that any form of socialism might be attempted.

Initially, the attempt required stepping back from war com-
munism and into the “New Economic Policy,” which required 
letting  prices  rise  and  fall,  letting  people  buy  and  sell  and  get 
richer, letting managers of government factories make profits (or 
be sacked), and letting a class of merchants and middlemen grow, 
as what Keynes called “tolerated outlaws.” It was an expediency. 
Capitalism,  but  subject  to  state  control;  socialized  state  enter-
prises, but run on a profit basis. And while the leash was rarely 
tugged, it remained.

Part of the expedience was due to the fact that the centralized 
Soviet  government  had  limited  grasp.  Even  by  the  mid-1930s, 
the  planners  could  only  track  material  balances  for  about  one 
hundred commodities. The movements of these were indeed cen-
trally planned. Nationwide, producers of these commodities who 
did not fulfill their goals according to the plan were sanctioned. 
Otherwise, commodities were exchanged between businesses and 
shipped out to users either through standard market cash-on-the-
barrelhead transactions or via blat: connections. Who you knew 
mattered.

When blat, market exchange, or central planning failed to 
obtain the raw materials an enterprise needed, there was another 
option: the tolkachi, or barter agents. Tolkachi would find out 
who  had  the  goods  you  needed,  what  they  were  valued,  and 
what goods you might be able to acquire given what you had to 
barter with.11

If this sounds degrees familiar, it should.
One hidden secret of capitalist business is that most companies’ 
internal organizations are a lot like the crude material balance cal-
culations of the Soviet planners. Inside the firm, commodities and 
time are not allocated through any kind of market access process. 
Individuals want to accomplish the mission of the organization, 
please their bosses so they get promoted, or at least so they don’t get 
fired, and assist others. They swap favors, formally or informally. 
They note that particular goals and benchmarks are high priorities,

and that the top bosses will be displeased if they are not accom-
plished. They use social engineering and arm- twisting skills. They 
ask for permission to outsource, or dig into their own pockets for 
incidentals. Market, barter, blat, and plan, this last understood as 
the organization’s primary purposes and people’s allegiance to it, 
always rule, albeit in different proportions.

The key difference, perhaps, is that a standard business firm 
is embedded in a much larger market economy, and so is always 
facing the make-or-buy decision: Can this resource be acquired 
most efficiently from elsewhere within the firm, via social engi-
neering or arm-twisting or blat, or is it better to seek budgetary 
authority to purchase it from outside? That make-or-buy decision 
is a powerful factor keeping businesses in capitalist market econ-
omies on their toes, and more efficient. And in capitalist market 
economies,  factory-owning  firms  are  surrounded  by  clouds  of 
middlemen. In the Soviet Union, the broad market interfaces of 
individual factories and the clouds of middlemen were absent. As 
a consequence, its economy was grossly wasteful.

Though wasteful, material balance control is an expedient that 
pretty much all societies adopt during wartime. Then hitting a 
small number of specific targets for production becomes the high-
est priority. In times of total mobilization, command-and-control 
seems the best we can do. But do we wish a society in which all 
times are times of total mobilization?

Lenin lived for only half a decade after his revolution. In May 
1922 he suffered a stroke, but he was back on his feet and in his 
office by July. In December he suffered a second stroke. In March 
1923 he suffered a third stroke, which temporarily affected his 
ability to speak. In January 1924 he fell into a coma and died. But 
he had had time to think about his succession—what committee 
or individual should follow him in guiding the dictatorship of the 
proletariat.

During his illness, in what is now called “Lenin’s Testament,” 

he wrote out what he thought of his probable successors:12

Joseph Stalin, he said, had “unlimited authority over person-
nel . . . which he may not be capable of always using with suffi-
cient caution.”

Leon Trotsky was “personally perhaps the most capable man,” 
but had “excessive self-assurance” and had “shown excessive pre-
occupation with the purely administrative side.”

Feliks Dzerzhinsky, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, and Joseph Stalin 

had all displayed “Great Russian chauvinism.”

Nikolai  Bukharin’s  “theoretical  views,”  he  said,  “can  be  
clas sified  as  fully  Marxist  only  with . . . great  reserve,  for  there 
is  something  scholastic”—that  is,  medieval  and  obscurantist— 
“about him.”

Georgy Pyatakov “show[ed] far too much zeal for adminis-
trating and the administrative side of the work to be relied upon 
in a serious political matter.”

And he added a postscript, saying that Stalin was “too coarse,” 
which would be “intolerable in a General Secretary.” Some, he 
wrote, had even tried to figure out how to remove Stalin from 
his current post as the general secretary of the Communist Party 
in favor of someone “more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and 
more considerate to the comrades, less capricious, etc.” This “de-
tail,” Lenin said, was of “decisive importance.”

Lenin had named Stalin general secretary after the Civil War. 
It was seen, by both Lenin and his inner circle, as a boring job, 
a simple job, a job for someone with a good work ethic who was 
committed to the party but otherwise without great gifts. Stalin’s 
control of personnel was a more powerful weapon than Lenin or 
any of the others had realized.

Among Lenin’s failings was that his late-in-life scribbled warn-
ings were insufficient. In the end, Lenin failed to use his prestige 
to anoint a successor. He refused to set up mechanisms by which 
the will of the people, or even of the industrial proletariat, could 
be ascertained. He failed to attend to this “detail,” which would 
indeed prove to be of “decisive importance.”

So the party would choose Lenin’s successor. And who was 
the party? The party was people. And who had chosen the peo-
ple?  Stalin.  Recruitment  drives  brought  the  party  membership 
up to one million. It was the general secretary—Stalin—who ap-
pointed local committee secretaries. Local secretaries appointed 
those who screened incoming members, and who chose the del-
egates to the Communist Party congresses—who would then do 
as their patron’s patron suggested.

And their patron’s patron was Stalin.
After Lenin’s death and a three-year interregnum, the party 
fell  into  line  and  accepted  Joseph  Stalin  in  the  driver’s  seat  in 
1927.

Before considering his character and the consequences of his 
decisions,  let’s  pause  briefly  to  consider  the  state  of  the  Soviet 
Union in those years. By 1927, the Soviet Union had recovered 
to where it had been in 1914—in terms of life expectancy, pop-
ulation, industrial production, and standards of living. The im-
perative of survival had been met. And there was no longer the 
deadweight  of  the  czarist  aristocracy  consuming  resources  and 
thinking  and  behaving  feudally.  As  long  as  Lenin’s  successors 
could avoid destroying the country through their own mistakes, 
and as long as they could keep encouraging people to judge their 
management  of  things  against  a  baseline  of  war  and  chaos,  it 
would be hard for them to fall out of favor.

The recovered Soviet Union remained subject to existential 
threats, to be sure. Those in the upper echelons of Soviet gov-
ernment greatly feared that the capitalist powers of the industrial 
core  would  decide  to  overthrow  their  regime.  Someday  soon, 
their  thinking  went,  the  really-existing  socialist  regime  might 
have to fight yet another war to survive. They remembered that 
they had already fought two: a civil war, in which Britain and  
Japan had at least thought about making a serious effort to sup-
port their enemies; and a war against Poland to the west. They 
were  desperately  aware  of  the  Soviet  Union’s  economic  and

political weaknesses. To meet external threats, the Soviet leaders 
had ideology, a small cadre of ruthless adherents, and a bureau-
cracy that sort of ran an economy recovered to its 1914 level. 
What they didn’t have was time.

They were not wrong.
I again give little away by acknowledging that on June 22, 
1941, Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union. 
Its aims were twofold: first, to exterminate Jewish Bolshevism as 
an idea, a political movement, and a regime; and second, to herd 
onto reservations, enslave, or exterminate the bulk of the inhab-
itants of the Soviet Union. The land they occupied was needed 
to  provide  larger  farms  for  German  farmers  and  more  “living 
space”—Lebensraum—for the German nation.13

There might have been another path. It was not foreordained 
that  the  Soviet  Union  would  turn  into  a  terror-ridden  prison 
camp. But Lenin’s refusal to plan for succession or create mech-
anisms for any form of normal politics within the Communist 
Party meant that Russia was likely to fall back into an old political 
pattern. It meant that Soviet Russia was likely to acquire a czar. 
And in a time of turmoil and troubles, a czar was likely to behave 
like  the  Rurik  dynasty’s  Dread  Ivan  IV—in  modern  English, 
“the Terrible” misses the mark. The czar they got was the Dread  
Joseph Stalin, born Ioseb Dzhugashvili: a paranoid psychopath, 
and one of the leading candidates for the greatest mass-murderer 
in human history.

Stalin had turned to revolutionary politics after being expelled 
from an Orthodox seminary. He was exiled to Siberia four times. 
All four times he escaped and returned to Georgia. To some this 
seemed suspicious. How did he escape so easily? And why was he 
not afterward afraid to return to his old stomping grounds? Trotsky 
and others would later come to claim that Stalin had spent his time 
before World War I as an agent provocateur who spied on the com-
munists for the Okhrana, the czar’s secret political police.

Really-Existing Socialism

No matter. In 1912 Lenin needed somebody to stir up ag-
itation at the fringes of the empire, and he chose Stalin. Stalin 
was  the  first  major  Bolshevik  to  return  to  what  was  then  the 
capital—St. Petersburg or Petrograd—after the fall of the czar 
in 1917. Lenin gave Stalin the post of editor of the party news-
paper, Pravda. During the Civil War he was responsible for try-
ing to cement the revolution among the same ethnic minorities 
he had agitated earlier that decade. As party general secretary, 
Stalin determined who would be in the party, which meant who 
and what would be the party. After World War II, East German 
playwright Bertolt Brecht observed that the ideal of his really- 
existing  socialist  masters  would  be  if  they  could  “dissolve  the 
people, and elect another.” As far as the party membership was 
concerned, their ideal was Stalin’s reality.14 It is no surprise then 
that Stalin came out on top, though he acquired many enemies 
in the process. Nor is it surprising that a paranoid personality 
like  Stalin  with  many  enemies,  including  powerful  ones,  took 
the next steps he did.

Dzerzhinsky died of a heart attack in 1926, before Stalin had 
consolidated power. Stalin shot all the others whom Lenin had 
mentioned in his testament, save for Leon Trotsky and perhaps 
Sergo Ordzhonikidze. Trotsky was exiled. He was then killed by 
Soviet  secret  police  in  Mexico  City  in  1940—with  an  icepick. 
Perhaps Ordzhonikidze managed to shoot himself before the se-
cret police could. We do not know. But, in short, Stalin silenced, 
and then executed, all of his former peers. And he promoted to 
the second rank of power people who were utterly dependent on 
him, and who served—and kept their lives—at his whim.

The Bolsheviks thought they were viewed by the non-socialist 
powers as an existential threat. And all the Bolsheviks agreed that 
to survive, Russia needed to industrialize rapidly. But how were 
they to persuade the peasants to boost agricultural production if 
they had no factory-made consumer goods to trade for their grain?

Marx had interpreted the economic history of Britain as one 
of  “primitive  accumulation.”  Landlords  had  used  the  political 
system to steal land from the peasantry and squeeze their stan-
dard of living. This forced some of the peasantry to migrate to 
the  cities,  where  they  became  a  penniless  urban  working  class. 
There, manufacturers and owners of means of production used 
the political system to force them to build and work in factories.
For Marx, this awful outcome was one of the things that made 
capitalism  an  obstacle  to  human  development  and  flourishing. 
The  Bolsheviks  took  Marx’s  critique  of  British  modernization 
and made it their business model. Not just Stalin, but Trotsky, 
Yevgeni  Preobrazhensky,  and  others  among  the  elite  had  con-
cluded that rapid industrialization was possible only if the ruling 
communists first waged economic war against Russia’s peasants. 
They would squeeze their standard of living as much as possible 
in order to feed and populate the growing industrial cities. They 
would keep urban wages high enough to provide a steady stream 
of migrants to city jobs, but no higher. This strategy was the first 
of what would ultimately become a series of Five-Year Plans.

The “goods famine” this policy generated shifted urban pro-
duction from consumer goods to capital goods, and from light 
industry to heavy industry—ultimately bringing about a “grain 
famine.” The result was a “scissors crisis”: As the price of indus-
trial goods manufactured in cities continued to rise to meet the 
government’s investment targets, the price of farm goods fell, and 
on the graph, the widening gap looked like a pair of scissors. Peas-
ants unable to buy manufactures (and increasingly uninterested 
in doing so) were also unable to sell farm goods. The cities strug-
gled to be fed, threatening the Five-Year Plan and Russia’s ability 
to industrialize, which Bolsheviks believed would determine its 
ability to survive.

Stalin  claimed  that  the  scissors  crisis  had  been  caused  by  a 
few bad apples: the kulaks, rich peasants who he thought were

holding back their grain in order to extort unfairly high prices. 
The kulaks, he said, were the problem.

No kulaks, no problem.
The government determined that it would have to do some-
thing about these peasants—the ones they believed were produc-
ing a surplus of agricultural products and yet were unwilling to 
deliver it up to the party. The solution? Conﬁscate their land and 
animals  and  force  them  onto  collective  farms  along  with  other 
peasants.  Tighten  down  their  standard  of  living,  though,  so  it 
would  be  a  little  bit  worse  than  the  others.  The  other  peasants 
would be happy, the party thought: only the kulaks would be up-
set—and their resistance could be handled. Thereafter, the entire 
agricultural surplus could be taken to the cities, with no need to 
supply the countryside with any consumer goods at all.

The government was wrong.
Some 94 percent of the Soviet Union’s twenty-five million 
peasant households were gathered into state and collective farms, 
averaging some fifty peasants per farm. Many peasants were shot; 
others died of famine. During the 1930s, millions were exiled to 
Siberian  prison  labor  camps.  Perhaps  fifteen  million  died.  Ag-
ricultural production dropped by a third. The number of farm 
animals in the Soviet Union dropped by half.15

Were there any benefits to the policy? Not likely. Food for the 
cities could have been obtained—more food on better terms—
by devoting a share of urban industrial production to consumer 
goods  that  farmers  would  find  useful  and  buy.  Serfdom  is  not 
a very efficient way of squeezing food out of the countryside— 
especially if the peasants see the serfdom coming and slaughter 
their  animals  and  eat  them  before  the  government  bureaucrats 
arrive to take them. It would have been far more efficient to have 
kept  millions  of  people  who  were  killed  alive  (was  it  two  mil-
lion? five? fifteen?) and engaged them in trading their agricultural 
goods for consumer products.

That there was a better way to have obtained results doesn’t 
mean the Bolsheviks didn’t obtain results. During the First and 
Second Five-Year Plans, Soviet statisticians claimed that indus-
trial  production—which  had  stood  11  percent  above  its  1913 
level in 1928—was some 181 percent higher by 1933, and some 
558 percent higher by 1938. Heavy industry had the highest pri-
ority: coal, steel, chemicals, and electricity. Consumer goods were 
to come later, if at all.

The  plans  consisted  of  a  series  of  selected  objectives— 
finish this dam, build so many blast furnaces, open so many coal 
mines—to be achieved whatever the cost. The aim was to build 
up heavy metallurgy. The task was to acquire—by buying from 
abroad or making at home—the technology that American heavy 
industry deployed. In this spirit, a “steel city” was to be built in the 
Urals, at Magnitogorsk, and supplied with coal from the Chinese 
border. Without Magnitogorsk, it is hard to see how Stalin could 
have won World War II, for the factories of western Russia were 
under German occupation from July 1941 until late 1943. Sim-
ilarly, dams, automobile factories, and tractor (or tank) factories 
were all built far to the east of Moscow. That there were far fewer 
people east of Moscow was a solvable problem.

How was Stalin to get workers to man the new heavy industrial 
plants—especially since he couldn’t pay them much? The answer 
was by drafting the population. Internal passports destroyed your 
freedom of movement. Access to housing and ration books de-
pended on you keeping your job (and satisfying your employer). 
Satisfying your employer also helped safeguard your life. For there 
was always the threat of Siberian exile to a concentration camp or 
a bullet in the neck for those whose bosses accused them of “sab-
otage.” At the start of the industrialization drive, there were show 
trials of engineers accused of being “plan-wreckers.”

Squeezing  the  rural  standard  of  living  further  produced  a 
mass exodus: as unhealthy and low paid as living in the cities was, 
for an adult male, being a semi-serf on the collective farm was

worse. More than twenty-five million people moved to the cities 
and the factories during the 1930s. And it worked, in its way. 
The Soviet Union would go on to outpace Germany and Britain 
in war weapons production during World War II—and many of 
the weapons were of acceptable quality. Acceptable, however, was 
set to a low bar. The Soviet T-34C tank was designed to last for 
six months and for only twenty-four hours of intensive combat.
The claims of nearly sevenfold growth in industrial produc-
tion from 1913 to 1940 were significantly exaggerated. Perhaps 
industrial  production  in  1940  was  (measured  using  standard 
techniques) 3.5 times industrial production in 1913. As best as 
one scholar could estimate, Soviet real national product grew at 
some 4.5 percent per year, on average, from 1928 to 1958, which 
was impressive. But the butcher’s bill was immense.

Factory workers were shot or exiled to labor camps for failing 
to meet production targets assigned from above. Intellectuals were 
shot or exiled to labor camps for being insufﬁciently pro-Stalin, 
or for not keeping up. Being in favor of the policies that Stalin 
had advocated in the previous year, but not in the current year, 
could also get you killed.

Communist activists, bureaucrats, and secret policemen fared 
no better. More than ﬁve million government ofﬁcials and party 
members were killed or exiled in the Great Purge of the 1930s. 
It is a grim historical irony that the most dangerous place to be 
in  the  Soviet  Union  in  the  1930s  was  among  the  high  cadres 
of the Communist Party. Of the 1,800 delegates to the party’s 
17th Congress in 1934, fewer than one in ten went on to become 
delegates to the 18th Congress in 1939. The rest were dead, in 
prison, or in Siberian exile. The most prominent generals of the 
Red Army were shot as well. The Communist Party at the start of 
World War II was more than half made up of those who had been 
recruited in the late 1930s, and all of them were keenly aware 
that they owed their jobs—and their status in Soviet society—to 
Stalin, Stalin’s protégés, and Stalin’s protégés’ protégés.

Because of the poor records kept, we really do not know the 
full butcher’s bill. We know more about how many cows and 
sheep died in the 1930s than about how many of Stalin’s op-
ponents, imagined enemies, and bystanders were killed. We do 
know that the Siberian concentration camps were filled by the 
millions, again and again and again. The “Gulag Archipelago” 
grew to encompass millions with the deportation of the kulaks 
during the collectivization of agriculture. It was filled again by 
the purges of the late 1930s. It was filled yet again by Poles, Lith-
uanians, Estonians, Latvians, and Moldavians, when the Soviet 
Union annexed those territories on the eve of World War II. Sol-
diers being disciplined, those critical of Stalin’s wartime leader-
ship, and members of ethnic groups thought to be pro-German 
were deported during World War II. After the war, perhaps four 
million Soviet soldiers who had been captured by the Germans 
and survived Hitler were sent to the Gulag. There they rotted 
and died.

Fascism and Nazism

The Russian novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote:

Macbeth’s  self-justifications  were  feeble. . . . Iago  was  a  lit-
tle  lamb. . . . The  imagination  and  the  spiritual  strength  of 
Shakespeare’s evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Be-
cause they had no ideology. Ideology—that is what gives evil-
doing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the 
necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social 
theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad 
in his own and others’ eyes, so that he won’t hear reproaches 
and curses but will receive praise and honors. . . . Thanks to 
ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evil-
doing on a scale calculated in the millions. This cannot be 
denied, nor passed over, nor suppressed.1

His  examples  included  the  Inquisition,  which  justified  its 
crimes by “invoking Christianity”; conquerors, who did the same 
by calling upon “the grandeur of the Motherland”; and then “col-
onizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race”; and the Jacobins, the 
most radical of the French Revolutionaries, “by equality, broth-
erhood, and the happiness of future generations.” To see a uto-
pian future in your mind’s eye and think that it is almost within

your grasp, and that your actions, even if severe, even if cruel and 
brutal, can bring it closer, out of the realm of fantasy, as a reality 
down here on earth—that is the curse of ideology.

Economic history is not immune to ideology. In large part, 
this is because economic historians aren’t immune to ideology. 
Numbers and indicators can support many interpretive stories. 
But,  as  Solzhenitsyn  pointed  out,  there  are  limits.  Intentional 
murder on the scale of tens of millions cannot be denied, passed 
over, or suppressed. Economic failures of catastrophic proportions 
that result in tens of millions of dead, by, say, famine, cannot be 
denied, passed over, or suppressed. The decades of grotesque ide-
ologies that fall in the middle of the long twentieth century make 
for difficult but necessary reading. They puncture political and 
economic ideology—though, I am always shocked to encounter, 
not fatally. And in the period between the world wars, three great 
ideologies  confronted  each  other,  demanding  fundamental  re-
working of economy and society.

We met one of the three overwhelming, totalizing ideologies 
of the twentieth century—by far the tamest of them—even be-
fore World War I: the market giveth, the market taketh away; 
blessed be the name of the market. And so major alterations were 
needed to purify the pre–World War I order, so that it could be 
strong. Ideology rests in that word “blessed.” Crossing that word 
with  social  Darwinism  has  proven  particular  pernicious.  The 
words of American steelmaster and philanthropist Andrew Carn-
egie are telling: “The price which society pays for the law of com-
petition . . . is also great,” he acknowledged. But, he added, “we 
cannot evade it; . . . and while the law may be sometimes hard for 
the individual, it is best for the race, because it insures the survival 
of the fittest.”2 Even the bad about what the laissez-faire market 
economy would grind out had to be seen as good.

We  met  the  second  of  the  ideologies  in  the  preceding  
chapter: the really-existing socialism of Lenin and Stalin. It, too, 
was  an  ideology  that  prescribed  pouring  immense  effort  into

reconfiguring the economy—in this case, to eliminate the market 
as a system, for that was what, ideology told them, was the root 
of all future evil, in that it blocked using the material abundance 
of industrialization to build a utopia that would really exist, and 
exist soon.

That Lenin and Stalin’s really-existing socialism was to accu-
mulate the largest butcher’s bill of any ideology was certainly not 
obvious at the start of the twentieth century. Nor was it obvious 
by the end of World War I. And it still was not obvious during 
the years leading up to the start of World War II.

A  great  many  thoughtful,  observant,  passionate  individu-
als would have without hesitation put their money on the third 
horseman:  fascism.  They  had  good  cause  to  do  so.  It  indeed 
looked to be the most terrible and most destructive ideology. In 
truth, had not all others—pragmatists, socialists, market worship-
ers, true liberals—gathered together to stop it, it would have won 
that race of terror. The fifty million or so killed by fascist move-
ments were just an appetizer-sized portion of the full meal that 
fascists wished to serve the world.

And fascism was also, at its root, an ideology that prescribed 
expending great effort to reconfigure the economy. The pre-fascist 
economy  organized  people  into  classes.  It  created  a  politics  of 
interest-group  bargaining  and  conflict.  But,  fascism  said,  what 
was needed was a unified national people, and a politics of soli-
darity and common purpose. The market economy of rich bosses 
bargaining with organized groups of workers could not produce 
that  unity.  Moreover,  the  world  economy  needed  a  redistribu-
tion of global resources. The big problem was not that there were 
proletarian—poor,  working,  overburdened—classes,  but  rather, 
that  there  were  proletarian—resource-  and  colony-  and  land- 
deprived—nations. One major purpose of a fascist leader was to 
make the world economy work for the benefit of the people of his 
nation—and not for some transnational global elite of “rootless 
cosmopolites.”

Benito  Mussolini  of  Italy  was,  up  until  the  start  of  World 
War II in Europe, the leader of world fascism. He had started out 
as the editor of an Italian socialist newspaper: Avanti!. He had ag-
itated Italian workers in Switzerland to start a general strike. He 
was arrested and deported. He had been an agitator for socialism 
in the mostly Italian-speaking alpine regions of the Austro-Hun-
garian Empire. He had protested Italy’s imperial adventure con-
quering Libya. By the eve of World War I he had become one of 
Italy’s most prominent socialist journalist-politicians.3

On July 29, 1914, the day after the Austro-Hungarian Em-
pire  declared  war  on  Serbia,  while  the  armies  were  mobilizing 
for World War I, Europe’s socialist leaders were mobilizing too. 
They came to Brussels for a meeting of the world’s Second Inter-
national. At previous meetings, in 1912 and 1907, all had agreed 
on the following: the working class knew no country; a threat of 
war should be met by a general strike; workers would put down 
their tools, bring the machines to a halt, stop the railroads liter-
ally on their tracks, and force war munitions factories to shutter 
their doors—then diplomats could do their work and maintain 
the peace.

But that day in Brussels, Austrian socialist leader Victor Adler 
announced  that  the  workers  of  Vienna  were  in  the  streets  not 
demonstrating for peace but chanting for war. It had long been 
Adler’s maxim that “it is better to be wrong with the working 
classes than right against them.”4 The Austrian socialists would 
support their Kaiser. In France, the president of the Council of 
Ministers, René Viviani, was a socialist. Viviani called on French 
workers  to  defend  their  country  against  those  whom  socialism 
decreed were their primary comrades. Only a handful of socialist 
leaders in belligerent nations stood against the war: Hugo Haase, 
Rosa Luxemburg, and Karl Liebknecht from Germany, and Vlad-
imir Lenin from Russia.

The socialists of Italy were not subject to this dilemma. They 
did  not  then  have  to  choose  between  their  pacifist  principles

and a government urging war for the sake of the nation. In 1882 
Italy  had  formed  a  defensive  military  alliance  with  Germany 
and Austria. The Italian government announced that Germany 
and Austria were not defenders, but aggressors. Consequently, 
Italy  would  stay  neutral.  The  Italian  socialists  applauded  the 
government.

Mussolini, however, was profoundly shaken by what had hap-
pened in Brussels, and by what he saw in the countries around 
him. The Second International had come up against the forces of 
nationalism and had collapsed. “I see no parties, only Germans,” 
declared the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II Hohenzollern. And he 
was, for that moment, right. What did it mean that, when push 
came  to  shove,  the  international  working  class  dissolved,  and 
what crystallized instead were nations within whom class divisions  
receded in importance?

The Italian socialists Mussolini knew and liked landed on the 
side of nationalism. They began to clamor to enter the war on the 
Allied side, with the aim of conquering Austria’s Italian-speaking 
regions. “Cardi, Corridoni, la Rygier,” Mussolini called them out 
by  name.  “Apologists  for  war!  It  is  a  contagion  that  spares  no 
one! But I want to hold the rampart to the end.”5 But even more, 
Mussolini wanted to be a leader of a mass movement. Mussolini 
was no George Orwell, who thought that one had a duty to go 
against the crowd when it was wrong, even when “to see what is 
in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.”6

And so, in the third month of the war, Mussolini abandoned 
the rampart. If the Italian workers he wanted to lead were going 
to be nationalists first and socialists second, he would join them. 
By the late fall of 1914, Mussolini had drawn a lesson from the 
collapse of the Second International and the mass enthusiasm of 
the working classes for war. Class had shattered under moderate 
pressure, and so could not carry the weight needed for a strong 
and durable mass movement. By contrast, the ethno-nation might 
well be strong enough.

Benito  Mussolini  had  become  convinced  of  the  psycholog-
ical  inadequacy  of  Marxian  socialism.  It  inspired  nothing  like 
the enormous outpouring of nationalist enthusiasm that he saw 
during the war. Socialism’s leaders seemed incapable of fully rec-
ognizing the fact that solidarity was associated with one’s national 
community—not with one’s international class or with humanity 
in general.

Being  a  socialist  seemed  inconsistent  with  leading  a  mass 
nationalist  movement,  and  that  seemed  to  be  the  only  kind  of 
movement  there  could  be.  So  Mussolini  started  his  own  new 
newspaper, Il Popolo d’Italia, calling for intervention on the side 
of France and Britain. His ex-comrades denounced him as having 
been bribed by the French intelligence service. (He probably had 
not been before his change; he almost surely was after—just what 
they were backing mattered less to the French than that they were 
backing a nascent Italian movement that wanted Italy to come 
into the war on France’s side.) On November 24, 1914, Mus-
solini was expelled from the Italian Socialist Party. The bridges 
had been burned. He had become an ex-socialist. He had become 
the leader of a movement that would be different, and stronger.

But what might that movement be?
Originally, Mussolini had just a placeholder, the word “fas-
cism.”  Originally,  he  had  just  an  observation:  that  while  the 
working classes were hard to mobilize for a largely economic in-
ternal struggle of protests, demonstrations, strikes, and votes to 
obtain respect and an end to poverty, they were easy to mobilize 
for a bloody and destructive war to reclaim, or rather claim, Alto 
Adige, Trentino, Friuli, Udine, and the city of Trieste. Appeals to 
an ethno-nation rooted in blood and soil drove masses to act in 
ways that appeals to abstract ideals, moral principles, and univer-
salist solidarity did not. Mussolini therefore felt his way forward 
into his doctrine. And many have followed him since.7

At the core of fascism as a movement was a contempt for lim-
its, especially those imposed by reason-based arguments; a belief

that reality could be altered by the will; and an exaltation of the 
violent assertion of that will as the ultimate argument—indeed, 
the only kind of argument that mattered. At the core of fascism 
as an ideology was a critique: semi-liberal industrial capitalism and 
parliamentary  government  had  had  its  chance,  and  had  failed. 
The failures had become manifest in several different ways, but 
all were linked together. The ideology was secondary, but it was 
not important. Why should someone choose to submit their will 
to that of some fascist leader? The ideology had to resonate with 
them for that to happen. So let us look at the failures that fascism 
ascribed to the pseudo-classical semi-liberal order that establish-
ment politicians were attempting to rebuild after World War I. 
And make no mistake: the failures were real.

The first was a macroeconomic failure: semi-liberal capitalism 
had  failed  to  guarantee  high  employment  and  rapid  economic 
growth.

The second was a distributional failure: either semi-liberal 
capitalism made the rich richer while everyone else stayed poor, 
or it failed to preserve an adequate income differential between 
the more-educated, more-respectable lower middle class and the 
unskilled industrial proletariat. It could not win. Depending on 
which aspect of income distribution was highlighted, either in-
dustrial  capitalism  produced  an  income  distribution  that  was 
too unequal (rich get richer, the rest stay poor) or not unequal 
enough  (respected  lower  middle  classes  slip  into  joining  the 
unskilled proletariat). That the charge of not-unequal-enough 
carried  an  implied  or  explicit  ethno-racial-religious  distinc-
tion—too much equality with Jews, or Poles, or Slavs, or any 
other  minority—lent  it  an  even  greater  ability  to  inspire  the  
national masses.

The  third  failure  was  a  moral  failure:  the  market  economy 
reduced all human relationships—or in any event many human 
relationships—to  arms-length  market  transactions—you  do 
this for me, and I will pay you. But people are not comfortable

dealing with each other as nothing but machines for transforming 
your money into useful commodities, or, vice versa, your labor 
into money. Contests and gift exchanges have more psycholog-
ical  resonance.  It  is  more  satisfying  to  receive  (or  give)  a  pres-
ent,  or  to  win  a  prize,  than  to  buy  the  exact  same  thing.  It  is 
more satisfying to receive genuine applause for your performance 
than to pay a claque. It is more inspiring to follow a leader than 
to be paid to join a crowd. By ignoring and trying to suppress 
these dimensions—  to require that everything pass through a cash 
nexus—the market society dehumanizes much of life.

Fourth  was  a  solidarity-recognition  failure:  the  pseudo- 
classical  semi-liberal  order  failed  to  acknowledge  that  everyone 
(that is, all citizens bound together by a given culture and con-
tained within given geographical borders) was in this together—
that inhabitants of an ethnic nation had common interests that 
were  much  more  powerful  than  any  one  individual’s  interest. 
Thus, economic policy needed to be made in a “syndicalist” or 
“corporatist” mode. This meant that the state needed to mediate 
between employers and unions, and the state needed to crack heads 
when necessary to make sure that employers and unions did the 
right thing. Not market forces, but government regulation, would 
set the price of labor and the quantity of employment, for those 
were too important for the health of society to be determined by 
the distribution of property and the workings of the market.

The fifth failure was governmental: not only was the semi- 
liberal economy flawed—so, too, was the semi-liberal government. 
Parliaments were incompetent. Cretinous. They were composed 
either of time-servers with no initiative, corrupt distributors of 
favors to special interests, or ideological champions who focused 
not on the public interest but on what made their own narrow 
slice  of  supporters  feel  good.  What  the  country  needed  was  a 
strong leader who would say what he thought and do what was 
needed without paying attention to norms or niceties.

Many of these real and declared shortcomings resulted in sim-
mering  to  boiling  discontent.  Giving  this  discontent  form  and 
direction helped decide the first two planks of fascism’s platform.
Nationalist assertion became Mussolini’s first plank. He de-
manded that Italy be “respected.” He demanded that the Italian 
border be moved north into the Alps and east into what would 
become  Yugoslavia.  Moved  how  far?  As  far  as  possible.  Anti- 
socialism became his second plank: that is, recruiting groups of 
young  thugs  and  sending  them  out  into  the  streets  to  beat  up 
socialists and disrupt working-class organizations.

“Corporatism,”  or  the  replacement  of  the  anarchy  of  the 
market by some form of government-administered planning, at 
least of wage levels and incomes, became his third plank. Fascism 
would embrace the dignity of work and of occupations, and not 
value every form of work and every worker solely by what the 
market wanted to pay them.

And  to  make  people  sit  up  and  behave—that  is,  subordi-
nate their class interests to their ethno-national interests—there 
needed to be a strong leader: Mussolini. This was less plank than 
precondition.  People  did  not  have  interests  that  politicians  ex-
isted to satisfy. Instead, people needed to be led and given a sense 
of national purpose by having their leader tell them what their 
interests were. Rulers should not listen and obey, but speak and 
command.

Was this thing called “fascism” real, or was this just a con game?
Perhaps  it  was  just  a  confidence  trick.  A  normal  political 
movement is based on interest groups who see their well-being as 
part of a good society, who have a view of how the world works 
that suggests certain policies to advance that well-being, and who 
then attempt to assemble coalitions to implement those policies. 
Fascism certainly was not a normal political movement.

To seize power, Mussolini needed to present himself as the 
prophet of a new ideology; he needed a doctrine in which to cloak

his personal despotism; and he needed to keep his opponents di-
vided and off balance. Fascism was opportunistic, and the lead-
ership principle could paper over contradictions. By this point of 
view, fascism was always a confidence game run by con artists. 
The goal of the one promoting fascism was to become a leader in 
order to gain status, wealth, and power. In order to do that, Mus-
solini needed to find people who wanted to be led. And then he 
had to undertake a delicate psychological negotiation with them 
to figure out where they wanted to be led to. Only then could he 
enthrall them, and then pick their pockets.

It  is  tempting  to  declare  that  the  greatest  trick  Mussolini 
ever  pulled  was  convincing  the  world,  or  at  least  much  of  
Italy, that he and fascism were the real deal. Unquestionably he 
succeeded  for  a  time.  Initially,  Italy’s  elected  politicians  tried 
alternately  to  suppress  and  to  ally  with  fascism.  In  1922,  af-
ter  winning  some  electoral  successes,  Mussolini  threatened  to 
make Italy ungovernable through large-scale political violence— 
unless  he  was  named  prime  minister.  The  king  named  him 
prime minister. From there he became dictator of Italy: Il Duce, 
or “The Leader.” By judicious murders, imprisonments, and po-
litical  wheeling-dealing,  he  remained  at  the  top  of  Italy  until 
the Western allied armies of Britain and the United States came 
knocking in 1943.

But while it is certainly true that “fascism” was disorganized, 
self-contradictory,  confused,  and  vague,  most  political  move-
ments embody these qualities. In forming a coalition or a party, 
the goal is to maintain friendships and alliances by blurring differ-
ences and avoiding conceptual clarity. Both tend to drive wedges 
among your followers.

Fascism’s claim to be something real rests on another, incon-
trovertible  fact:  in  the  twentieth  century,  it  had  too  many  ad-
herents to be only an illusionary confidence trick, even if most 
fascists most of the time were clearer on what they were against

than what they were for. I count six elements usually found in 
regimes that called themselves “fascist”: a leadership command-
ing rather than representing; a unified community based on ties 
of blood and soil (and rejecting and degrading those who are not 
of the community); coordination and propaganda; support for at 
least some traditional hierarchies; hatred of socialists and liberals; 
and—almost always—hatred of “rootless cosmopolites,” which, 
in their antisemitic worldview, meant Jews and people who acted 
like Jews, in some form or another.

Fascism was also often considered to be the only game in town. 
This is certainly true if you do not approve of liberal democracy, 
or  if  you  fear  socialism  and  believe  that  liberal  democracy  will 
inevitably  lead  to  socialism,  once  the  working  class  realizes  its 
voting strength. For many after World War I, it seemed clear that 
restoring the Old Order was impossible. For many anti-socialists, 
therefore,  fascism  appeared  to  them  to  be  the  only  choice  left 
standing.  Monarchy  was  out.  An  aristocracy  of  birth  and  rank 
was out. Theocracy was out. Plutocracy had difficulties keeping 
a mass base. Fascism was it. And a lot of people were (and are) 
willing to endorse and support it.

Indeed,  someone  living  between  the  world  wars  looking  at 
European and Latin American governments could easily become 
convinced  that  fascism  was  the  wave  of  the  future.  Nearly  ev-
erywhere, democracy was in retreat, unable to provide answers 
to the economic problems of the Great Depression or to resolve 
social  conflicts.  On  the  eve  of  World  War  II,  democracies  in 
the world were few and far between: Great Britain and its Do-
minions  (Australia,  New  Zealand,  Canada,  and  perhaps  South 
Africa), the United States (if you were white), Ireland, France, 
the Low Countries (Belgium, Holland, and Luxembourg), and 
Scandinavia  (Finland,  Sweden,  Norway,  and  Denmark).  That 
was it. Everywhere else you had authoritarian, nondemocratic, or 
anti-democratic governments of the left or the right.

IN GERMANY AFTER WORLD War I, supporters of the German 
Socialist Party were called Sozis—the first two syllables of Sozial-
ist. For some reason, urban Bavarians made fun of people named 
Ignatz. The name was a stand-in for a what in English is a coun-
try bumpkin: someone rural, foolish, and awkward. There was a 
diminutive nickname for Ignatz: Nazi. Hence the political ene-
mies of Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist German Workers’ 
Party in Bavaria in the 1920s began calling them a mash-up of 
these terms, “Nazis.” The name stuck.

Once  Adolf  Hitler  seized  power  in  1933  and  consolidated 
it in 1934, he was, with reason, popular.8 Germany had recov-
ered from the Great Depression relatively rapidly once Hitler had 
taken power and broken adherence to monetary and fiscal ortho-
doxy. With the Gestapo in the background to suppress agitation 
for higher wages, better working conditions, or the right to strike, 
and with strong demand from the government for public works 
and military programs, unemployment fell during the 1930s. The 
Great Depression in Germany had been the deepest in the world 
save for the United States. Recovery in Germany was fastest, save 
for Japan and Scandinavia.

Hitler in power during peacetime appears to have been fo-
cused on boosting employment and building weapons, not add-
ing to industrial capacity and increasing national wealth. Build 
national  highways,  yes—but  build  them  not  by  building  indi-
vidual city-to-city or resources-to-industry links, but by building 
first where it would be seen by as many as possible. Political effec-
tiveness and military capacity were the priorities.

Political  effectiveness  we  understand:  The  Nazi  movement 
was still a minority movement. Even at its high point it could 
command a majority in the Reichstag, the legislature, only with 
the socialist and communist deputies excluded from the room. 
And even then, this rump legislature was only willing to vote to 
give Hitler emergency and dictatorial powers in the panic that 
followed the “mysterious” burning of the Reichstag’s building. In

part because of their minority-majority, Hitler and his party did 
see building more and stronger political support as a priority—
hence jobs, and at least the appearance of a government that was 
building large infrastructure projects.

But weapons? Armies? How do we understand these as pri-
orities? One could order up one world war from the menu by 
mistake. But why in the Holy Name of the One Who Is would 
anyone ever, ever order up two?

Hitler disagreed. Hitler had actually rather liked World War I.
Hitler’s experiences during World War I do not seem to add 
up to what a normal person would regard as a “good war.” But he 
thought they did.9

He  enlisted—untrained—in  the  Bavarian  Army  in  August 
1914,  after  having  been  rejected  by  his  Austrian  homeland  as 
unfit for military service. In October he joined the 16th Bavar-
ian  Reserve  Regiment,  or  List  Regiment  (named  after  its  first 
commander), part of nine new and largely untrained infantry di-
visions that were thrown immediately into combat on an emer-
gency basis. The 16th was sent to the First Battle of Ypres, where 
the Germans faced the British, and it was the first mauling that 
the 16th Bavarian Reserve Regiment underwent.

The  Germans  called  this  the  Kindermord,  the  child-death. 
That is an explicit reference to the biblical massacre of the in-
nocent babies of Bethlehem by King Herod of Judea following 
the birth of Christ. Perhaps the analogy is apt: in all, 40,000 of 
90,000 Germans were killed or wounded in twenty days. By the 
end of the battle, of the 16th’s original company of 250, only 
42 men were alive, out of the hospital, and able to present for 
further duty.

The List Regiment, like so many others during World War 
I, followed a predictable pattern: inexperienced, they were sent 
into the fight, where they were chewed up, a decent percent were 
thrown away, a modest percent were regrouped, repeat. The List 
Regiment was sacrificed over and over again, in the Battles of the

Somme (1916), Fromelles (1916), Arras (1917), and Passchen-
daele  (1917).  The  casualties  were  horrifying—in  the  hundreds 
of thousands—in each battle. Hitler was wounded in the thigh 
in 1916 by a shell exploding at his dugout entrance. He was hos-
pitalized  for  two  months.  He  was  then  ordered  to  the  reserves 
behind the line in Munich. He could not stand it. With his com-
rades under fire, he begged to be recalled back to the front. His 
wish was granted. He was then (temporarily) blinded and struck 
dumb by a British gas attack in October 1918. He spent the last 
twenty-five days of the war in the hospital.

Yet these experiences did not put him off war.
Hitler was then demobilized and set adrift. No matter his ded-
ication, his conduct had not been such that he was one of those 
soldiers the General Staff wanted to keep for the peacetime army. 
But Major Karl Mayr of the army’s Intelligence Division picked 
him up as an undercover operative in mid-1919. Mayr sent him 
to spy on socialists. One small socialist group he was sent to spy 
on was Anton Drexler’s German Workers’ Party. Drexler found 
Hitler to be “an absurd little man.” But he was also impressed 
with Hitler’s ability to speak. Drexler invited Hitler to join his 
party in September 1919.

Drexler’s  party  became  the  Nazi  Party  five  months  later, 
when “National” and “Socialist” were added at the front of its 
name, “National” with Hitler’s enthusiastic support, and “Social-
ist” over his objection. The idea seems to have been that the full 
name change might lure Germans looking for a socialist meeting 
to  wander  in.  Since  the  Nazis  were,  like  the  socialists,  recruit-
ing from the groups for whom the system was not working, such 
wanderers-in might stay. Later it was too late to change the name 
of the party. And by that point it had become the party of Hitler 
first and foremost, mooting the name.

A sliver, albeit a highly telling sliver, of what the party of Hit-
ler stood for can be glimpsed in how it treated the men who gave 
Hitler his first legs up into it.

In 1921, Hitler would ultimately push the man who invited 
him  into  the  party,  and  who  thereafter  mentored  him,  Anton 
Drexler, out of the Nazi leadership. Drexler resigned from the 
party  in  1923.  In  Mein  Kampf,  published  in  1925,  years  after 
Drexler  had  done  all  that  he  could  for  his  mentee,  Hitler  de-
scribed Drexler as “a simple worker, as speaker not very gifted, 
moreover no soldier.” He added that he was “weak and uncer-
tain”; “not a real leader”; and “not cut out to be fanatical enough 
to carry the movement in [his heart],” or “to use brutal means to 
overcome the opposition to a new idea.”10 Drexler died of nat-
ural causes in the Bavarian city of Munich in 1942. He got off 
relatively easy.

The man who recruited Hitler to spy on Drexler’s party, Karl 
Mayr, started out on the German right and steadily moved left. 
In 1925 he joined the Socialist Party, where he led some of the 
socialist left-wing paramilitary street bullies. In 1933, after Hitler 
assumed dictatorial power, Mayr fled to France. When the Nazis 
conquered France in 1940, he was on the Gestapo’s list. He was 
sent first to the Sachsenhausen and then to the Buchenwald con-
centration camp. There he was murdered on February 9, 1945.

Most  of  what  Nazism  stood  for  can  be  grasped  by  under-
standing Adolf Hitler’s deadly serious appreciation for the work 
of economist Thomas Robert Malthus from the turn of the nine-
teenth century.

It has been chapters since we last crossed paths with Malthus, 
the  pessimist  who  gloomily  predicted  that  human  populations 
would outrun their food supply. When people and food got out 
of balance, too much of the former given not enough of the latter, 
Malthus argued, nature or mankind would provide a corrective. 
It would come in the forms, one or all, of war, famine, disease, 
and death; or (a better alternative) “moral restraint.” This would 
be evidenced by late marriages and infrequent sex supported by 
strong religious faith, practices Malthus believed allowed a small 
gap between the edge of starvation and average living standards.

From  those  earlier  chapters  we  know  Malthus  as  someone 
whose  doctrines  provided  a  good  description  of  life  before  he 
wrote, but were a bad guide to subsequent history. When looking 
backward, the lesson he drew was less a lesson than a trap, and an 
inevitable one at that: population growth checked by insufficient 
foodstuffs would produce poverty. But in post-Malthus history 
the rationalization and routinization of scientific discovery, tech-
nological innovation, and mass-scale deployment had banished 
the Malthusian Devil.

Hitler,  however,  drew  different  lessons  from  Malthus.  The 
Malthusian trap, with more than a dash of social Darwinism, was, 
he argued, useful for thinking about foreign policy. “Germany,” 
he wrote in Mein Kampf, “has an annual increase in population 
of nearly nine hundred thousand souls. The difficulty of feeding 
this army of new citizens must grow greater from year to year and 
ultimately end in catastrophe.”11

Hitler  saw  four  options.  One  was  birth  control  to  reduce 
population growth. But Hitler saw any check on the number 
of  Germans  as  weakening  the  German  race.  A  second  was  to 
increase agricultural productivity, but he saw this endeavor as 
doomed  for  the  same  reason  that  Malthus  did:  diminishing 
returns.  A  third  was  to  purchase  food  from  abroad  by  “pro-
duc[ing]  for  foreign  needs  through  industry  and  commerce.” 
Hitler deemed this option “unhealthy.” Moreover, he saw it as 
unrealistic: Britain would never allow Germany to become the 
dominant industrial and mercantile power without a fight, and 
if it could wield the hunger weapon again—as it had with the 
World War I blockade—Britain would win.

What was left? The fourth way: territorial expansion. Hitler 

went on to write:

We  must . . . coolly  and  objectively,  adopt  the  standpoint 
that it can certainly not be the intention of Heaven to give 
one  people  fifty  times  as  much  land  and  soil  in  this  world 

274

as  another. . . . [W]e  must  not  let  political  boundaries  ob-
scure for us the boundaries of internal justice. . . . The law of 
self-preservation goes into effect; and what is refused to am-
icable methods it is up to the fist to take. . . . If land was de-
sired in Europe, it could be obtained by and large only at the 
expense of Russia, and this meant that the new Reich must 
again set itself on the march along the road of the Teutonic 
knights of old, to obtain by the German sword sod for the 
German plow and daily bread for the nation.12

Standing  atop  historical  inaccuracies  and  mystical  justifica-
tions,  Hitler  concluded  that  Germany  must  continue  that  bar-
baric, bloody quest: “We take up where we broke off six hundred 
years ago. We stop the endless German movement to the south 
and west, and turn our gaze toward the land in the east. At long 
last we break off the colonial and commercial policy of the pre-
War period and shift to the soil policy of the future”13

But  how  could  Germany  expand  to  the  east?  Here  he  was 
certain  that  fate  (or  Heaven,  or  cosmic  justice,  or  the  laws  of 
self-preservation)  had  already  intervened  on  Germany’s  behalf. 
“By handing Russia to Bolshevism, it robbed the Russian nation” 
of the “Germanic nucleus of its upper leading strata.” That group, 
he  said,  had  been  “replaced  by  the  [Bolshevik]  Jew.”  Drawing 
upon thousands of years of antisemitic hate, fear, and loathing, 
now cloaked in scientific-sounding social Darwinism, Hitler de-
clared that it was “impossible for the Jew to maintain the mighty 
[Russian]  empire  forever.”  Therefore,  “the  giant  empire  in  the 
east is ripe for collapse.”

All Germany had to do was make sure that it had an army 
large enough to be prepared when the collapse would come. Be 
prepared,  but  also  be  impatient.  As  Hitler  said  in  June  1941, 
when he launched the Nazi armies into Russia, “You only have to 
kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crash-
ing down.”

Now we see the four braided assumptions at Nazism’s center. 
First, a strong dose of German antisemitism. Second, a belief in 
the German nation and the “Aryan” German race as an entity 
with a special, heroic destiny. Third, the understanding that war 
was the ultimate test of national and racial strength and worth. 
And, fourth, the idea that conquest, which explicitly required the 
extermination or removal of populations, was necessary to cre-
ate more “living space” for Germans, especially German farmers, 
who would oversee large fields yielding the agricultural produc-
tion necessary to feed Germans.

Essential to this braided core were three presumptions: First, 
the leadership principle. This was not just the belief that an in-
spired leader was essential to a good political order; rather, it was 
an  active  disdain—even  hatred—of  any  obstacle  to  that  lead-
er’s ambitions, including, especially, parliamentary institutions, 
which Hitler believed engaged in ineffectual and disgraceful bar-
gaining practices on behalf of interest groups. Second, the use of 
terror  to  obtain  obedience.  And  third,  the  desire  to  make  sure 
that all of society, from its citizens to its organizations, served the 
national cause.

There you have Nazism. Whereas really-existing socialism in 
the Soviet Union started with utopian expectations, only to end 
up mired in dystopian horrors, Nazism began with dystopian ex-
pectations, looking forward to inevitable violent contests of races 
and nations—and fully realized the sought-out dystopian horrors.
Hitler tested his Malthusian economics–based Aryan- racial-
domination  ideology,  Nazism,  on  March  15,  1939,  when  he 
gambled  by  ordering  German  tanks  to  roll  (unopposed)  into 
Prague, thereby annexing Czechoslovakia. He took it more seri-
ously yet on September 1, 1939, when he ordered German tanks 
to roll across the Polish border, this time meeting resistance, but 
easily crushing the Polish army (in less than three weeks), and 
beginning the European phase of World War II. He then pur-
sued  his  new  ideology  with  existential  earnestness  on  June  22,

1941, when German tanks rolled (opposed) across the Soviet bor-
der, and Germany—still engaged in a brutal war with the British  
Empire—took on the Soviet Union as well. The entire point of 
Hitler’s foreign policy, after all, was the drive to the east, to win 
by the sword bread for the German nation and sod for the Ger-
man plow. In so doing, he sought to exterminate, expel, or en-
slave all the Slavic peoples across Germany’s eastern border.

And he took the braided logics of Nazism in genocidal ear-
nestness  by  implementing,  with  millions  of  abettors,  the  Final 
Solution to the “Jewish Problem.”14

Perhaps fifty million people died because of Hitler’s wars. But 
if  the  Nazis  had  won  their  war—conquered  Europe  up  to  the 
Urals, and filled the land with ethnic German landlord-farmer- 
estates—that number would have more than tripled. And after-
ward, what would race-maddened victorious Nazis have done in 
Africa? And in Asia east and south of the Urals?

It is a question history and ideology provides an answer to.

HAVE I COMMITTED AN error by lumping fascists in with Nazis?
A great many people did (and some still do) applaud fascists, 

after all.

The  political  philosopher  Leo  Strauss,  who  had  been  born 
in  Germany  in  1899  to  German  Jewish  parents,  emigrated  to 
Paris  in  1932  and  to  the  United  States  in  1937,  where  he  be-
came a professor at the University of Chicago. Teacher of some 
and darling of many on America’s intellectual political right, he 
proudly stated in 1933 that even though the Nazis were misap-
plying them, he remained a believer in “fascist, authoritarian and 
imperial” principles.15

Economist  and  darling  of  the  far  right  Ludwig  von  Mises, 
born  to  Jewish  parents  in  Austria-Hungary,  in  what  is  now 
Ukraine, wrote of fascism in 1927, “Fascism and similar move-
ments aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the

best intentions . . . [and] their intervention has, for the moment, 
saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby 
won for itself will live on eternally in history.”16 True, in the same 
work he called it an “emergency makeshift” arrangement; warned 
that  “view[ing]  it  as  something  more  would  be  a  fatal  error”;  
and denounced it for “its complete faith in the decisive power of 
violence”—for, in his view, ideas rather than fists and clubs were 
needed to decisively scotch socialism. In 1940, the Jewish-born 
Mises,  too,  emigrated  to  the  United  States  (via  Switzerland  in 
1934), acknowledging that fists trump intentions.

At  the  start  of  the  1980s,  libertarian  darling  Friedrich  von 
Hayek wrote a letter to Margaret Thatcher suggesting that the 
British  hew  more  closely  to  the  methods  of  fascistic  Augusto  
Pinochet, whose 1973 Cold War coup overthrowing and mur-
dering President Salvador Allende Hayek had greatly applauded, 
as rescuing Chile from the road to serfdom. We catch his urged 
sympathies in her politely worded reply. Thatcher wrote, “Some 
of the measures adopted in Chile are quite unacceptable. . . . We 
shall achieve our reforms in our own way and in our own time.”17 
All of these—save Thatcher—at least flirted with at least a tempo-
rary and tactical alliance with and allegiance to fascism, and some 
of them did much, much more: believing that representative de-
mocracy could not summon the strength to resist really-existing 
socialism, and believing that that disastrous threat to civilization 
called for desperate measures and alliances in response.

In  seeing  history’s  fascists,  as  they  have  cropped  up  across 
continents and over decades, as part of the same species as Hit-
ler and his company of genocidal madmen, am I illegitimately 
tarring their views? It is certainly true that if fascists are all of the 
same  species,  many  were  much  tamer  versions  than  the  Nazis. 
Most fascists’ economic doctrines were largely negative: they were 
not socialists, and they did not believe that the Marxist platform 
of  the  nationalization  of  industry  and  the  expropriation  of  the 
capitalist class was the right way to run an economy. But neither

did they buy into the “national living space” doctrines of Hitler. 
They were less antisemitic, and they were less murderous than 
the Nazis.

But  other  fascists  were  identifiably  of  the  same  ideological 
genus  as  the  Nazis.  They  recognized  each  other.  It  is  no  acci-
dent  that  Hitler  wrote  of  his  “profoundest  admiration  for  the 
great man south of the Alps,” Benito Mussolini, the founder of 
fascism.18 It is also no accident that Mussolini allied with Hitler 
during World War II, or that both Hitler and Mussolini sent aid 
to Francisco Franco’s Royalist rebels in the Spanish Civil War of 
the late 1930s. No more accidental, in any case, than the fact that 
Nazis fleeing Europe after the collapse of Hitler’s Third Reich 
found a welcome in Juan Perón’s Argentina.

Have I committed an error by not lumping fascists in with 
really-existing socialists? After all, how much light really shines 
between the fascist and the really-existing socialist?

A distressing number of people, starting with Mussolini him-
self, seem to have transited from one to the other directly. That 
suggests not a left-right political spectrum but rather a horseshoe, 
or even a color wheel. Red and blue are as far apart in terms of 
visual wavelengths as colors can be. Yet if you take magenta paint 
and add a little bit of cyan you get blue; if you take magenta and 
add a little bit of yellow you get red. George Orwell famously 
asked, “But aren’t we all socialists?”19 He was in Barcelona, it was 
1937, and the Stalinist-backed socialists were exterminating the 
Spanish Marxist faction that he had joined when he arrived in the 
city (the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification). All the while, 
Franco’s fascists waited outside the city.

There were important policy differences.
As Hermann Rauschning claimed Hitler had said to him, 
“Why need we trouble to socialize banks and factories? We so-
cialize human beings!”20 That is to say, really-existing socialism 
focuses first on control over institutions and commodity flows 
and  only  secondarily  on  control  over  what  people  think,  say,

and do—but we focus first on what people think, say, and do. 
How  profound  a  difference  was  this  really?  And  while  status 
inequality  was  important  to  really-existing  socialists,  material 
inequality  and  ruling-class  luxury  was . . . embarrassing.  By 
contrast, for fascists, if material inequality and ruling-class lux-
ury bothered you, it only demonstrated that you were not really 
with the program.

But do these constitute a difference in species, or just varia-

tion within a species properly called “totalitarian”?

Let us bring in as a reference British socialist historian Eric 
Hobsbawm—a  card-carrying  communist  from  before  World 
War  II  until  1956,  thereafter  becoming  more  moderate—who 
had a couple of asides in his histories that strike me as revealing. 
The first comes in his 1994 book The Age of Extremes, a history 
of what he called the short twentieth century, or the period from 
the start of World War I in 1914 to the fall of the Soviet Union in 
1991. Hobsbawm, writing in his old age, still believed that join-
ing a “Moscow-aligned Communist party” was, for those who de-
sired global revolution, “the only game in town”: “Lenin’s ‘party 
of a new type’ . . . gave even small organizations disproportionate 
effectiveness,  because  the  party  could  command  extraordinary 
devotion and self-sacrifice from its members, more than military 
discipline and cohesiveness, and a total concentration on carrying 
out party decisions at all costs,” he wrote. “This impressed even 
hostile observers profoundly.”21

Is there a hair’s breadth of difference between the fascists’ wor-
ship of a heroic leader and Hobsbawm’s belief that unthinking 
obedience to the dictator in Moscow—whoever he might be—
who had murdered nearly all of his peers—was praiseworthy, and 
profoundly impressive? To accept that being a follower meant de-
votion and self-sacrifice at all costs would absolutely have earned 
Mussolini’s and Hitler’s approval. “This is a fascist coup” were 
perhaps the last words of Stalin’s peer Bolshevik Gregory Zino-
viev, as Stalin’s henchmen shot him.22

Fascism and Nazism

BEFORE  THE  TWENTIETH  CENTURY,  ideology—as  opposed  to 
religion—did not kill people by the millions and tens of millions. 
The  stakes  were  not  thought  to  be  worth  it.  Such  enthusiasm 
for  mass  murder  awaited  the  combination  of  aristocratic  mili-
tarism,  really-existing  socialism,  and  fascism.  Thus  it  was  only 
in the twentieth century that utopian aspirations about how the 
economy should be organized led nations and global movements 
to build dystopias to try to bring the utopian future closer. And 
then they turned around and justified the dystopia: compromises 
must be made, and this is as good as it is going to get.

My view is that too much mental and historical energy has 
been spent parsing differences between movements that are justly 
classified as dystopian, and even totalitarian, in aspiration. Time 
spent on such a task is time wasted, given their commonalities—
if not in formal doctrine, then at least in modes of operation. The 
guards of Auschwitz, Majdanek, Treblinka, Dachau, and the rest 
were very like the guards of the Gulag Archipelago.

Rather,  mental  and  historical  energy  should  be  focused  on 
where these movements got their energy. Why was the world un-
able to offer people a society in which they could live good lives? 
Why was a total reconfiguration necessary? Karl Polanyi saw fas-
cism and socialism as reactions against the market society’s inabil-
ity or unwillingness to satisfy people’s Polanyian rights. It could 
not guarantee them a comfortable community in which to live 
because the use to which land was put had to pass a profitability 
test. It could not offer them an income commensurate with what 
they deserved because the wage paid to their occupation had to 
pass a profitability test. And it could not offer them stable em-
ployment because the financing to support whatever value chain 
they were embedded in also had to pass a profitability test. These 
failures all gave energy to the thought that there needed to be a 
fundamental reconfiguration of economy and society that would 
respect people’s Polanyian rights. And the hope of millions was 
that fascism and really-existing socialism would do so.

Instead, both turned out to erase, in brutal and absolute ways, 
people’s rights, and people’s lives, by the millions. So why were 
people  so  gullible?  The  German  socialist  Rosa  Luxemburg  in 
1919 could see the path Lenin was embarked upon and called it 
“a brutalization of public life: attempted assassinations, shooting 
of hostages, etc.”23 The German liberal Max Weber, writing in 
1918, could also foresee what would become of Lenin’s sociolog-
ical experiment, saying it would end in “a laboratory with heaps 
of human corpses.”24 Similarly, the British diplomat Eric Phipps 
wrote in 1935 that if Britain were to take Hitler’s Mein Kampf 
seriously and literally, “we should logically be bound to adopt the 
policy of a ‘preventive’ war.”25

The dangers of a fascist turn were clear. The unlikelihood of 
success at even slouching toward a good society of those who took 
that turn ought to have been obvious.

Utopian faith is a helluva drug.

World War II

D uring  the  1930s,  while  most  other  countries  continued 

to  stagnate  in  the  Great  Depression,  Germany  recovered 
rapidly. But Nazi ideology made plain that a recovery fueled by 
peaceful spending was not what Hitler’s regime was about.

In March 1935, Hitler announced that Germany was break-
ing the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles and rearming.1 The 
victorious  allies  of  World  War  I  faced  a  knotty  foreign  policy 
problem. The isolationist United States was uninterested in send-
ing soldiers and garrisons to Europe. The British and French elec-
torates definitely did not want to do World War I again. And 
Hitler’s program of rearmament and national self-assertion de-
manded that Britain and France make a choice.

The diplomatic jostling of the 1930s was unequal, and not 
because Britain and France were well armed and less affected by 
the Great Depression, while Germany was disarmed and deeply 
depressed. The jostling was unequal because Britain and France 
did not want to get close to war, and were certain nobody else 
wanted to, either, as they then might fall into another one as hor-
rible as the last. The jostling was unequal because Hitler did not 
share their view. Nor did the German power structure share it.

The policies of Britain and France can rightly be called strat-
egies  of  appeasement:  Give  Hitler  diplomatic  victories.  Dribble

them out. Get him invested in small successes, so he would honor 
the commitments he had made to gain them. As British ambas-
sador Eric Phipps wrote in his diary in 1935, if they could “bind 
him . . . by an agreement bearing his signature,” he might “hon-
our it”: “Agreement only partially agreeable to Great Britain and 
France and not too distasteful to Italy might prevent for a time 
any  further  German  shots  among  the  International  ducks,”  he 
wrote. “Years might then pass and even Hitler might grow old.”2

If that was the strategy, it did not work.
When Hitler began his diplomatic campaign, he had a pow-
erful array of arguments on his side. The Versailles Treaty that 
had ended World War I had restricted the German army to one 
hundred thousand soldiers. But the other nations of the world 
had never cut back their own armies. Was Germany to be the 
only great power to fear invasion from Denmark or Yugoslavia? 
That was not fair. And the response that Nazi Germany was a 
pariah  nation—ruled  by  a  cruel,  oppressive  dictatorship—was 
not  a  statement  that  made  sense  in  the  language  of  European 
diplomacy. The idea that what a duly recognized government did 
within its borders was of no concern to the world’s other govern-
ments was deeply ingrained.

What did make sense in the language of European diplomacy 
was language: the language that a majority of people in any given 
village  spoke.  The  Versailles  Treaty,  and  the  other  aspects  of 
the post–World War I settlement, had tried, imperfectly, but as 
much as was possible, to redraw national borders along linguis-
tic lines. Except for Germany. Linguistic German speakers were 
ruled  not  just  from  Berlin  but  from  Rome,  Vienna,  Budapest, 
Prague, Warsaw, Vilnius, Paris, and even Bucharest.

As long as Hitler restricted his foreign policy goals to remov-
ing the restrictions on German armaments that made Germany a 
less-than-equal nation, and to trying to “settle” national minority 
problems by redrawing borders to more closely match linguistic 
lines, it was hard for Britain, France, and others to say no.

World War II

After  all,  did  Britain  and  France  want  to  invade  Germany, 
depose Hitler, and set up an unstable puppet government bound 
to further inflame German nationalism? Well yes, they did, but 
pretty  much  only  Winston  Churchill  had  the  foresight  to  rec-
ognize  that  such  a  step  was  the  least-bad  option.3  And  he  was 
regarded as harebrained: he had been wrong in wishing to make 
no compromise with Indians seeking self-government, wrong in 
his aggressive embrace of deflation as Britain’s finance minister 
in  1925,  wrong  in  his  support  of  King  Edward  VII  in  his  de-
sire to marry the twice-divorced social-climbing Wallis Warfield 
Spencer Simpson, and (they said) wrong in his plans for winning 
World War I not in France and Belgium but in Turkey.4 Why 
should anyone think he was right in his fearmongering about a 
German threat?

In the middle of the Great Depression, French and British 
political leaders believed that they had bigger problems than en-
forcing every jot and tittle provision of the Treaty of Versailles. 
And  some  wished  actively  to  see  Germany  rejoin  the  commu-
nity  of  Western  European  nations.  With  Germany  effectively 
disarmed, there was a power vacuum between the border of the 
Soviet Union and the Rhine River. Poland and the Soviet Union 
had  fought  one  war  in  the  early  1920s  that  had  seen  the  Red 
Army approach Warsaw before being turned back. Wise men said 
a strong German army could serve as a buffer against communist 
Russia. In the 1930s, as the German army, navy, and air force 
demonstrably grew past treaty limits, Britain and France did ef-
fectively nothing.

Hitler  broke  yet  another  provision  of  the  Treaty  of  Ver-
sailles in March 1936: he moved token military forces into the 
Rhineland, the province of Germany west of the Rhine that had 
been demilitarized after 1918. Britain and France faced the same 
choice again. And once again it seemed pointless to act. No other 
European  country  had  demilitarized  zones  within  its  borders.  
To require that Germany maintain a demilitarized zone seemed

only apt to inflame German nationalism. And, once again, to en-
force the provision would presumably require an invasion of Ger-
many, the deposition of Hitler, and the installation of a puppet 
government.

Hitler annexed Austria in March 1938. Austria was inhabited 
overwhelmingly by ethnic Germans who all spoke German. In 
annexing  Austria,  Hitler  declared,  he  was  simply  gathering  the 
German people into their proper one nation and reversing a po-
litical error committed in the late nineteenth century, when the 
Austrian Germans were excluded from the political boundaries 
of Germany. Had but the Allies applied the same national self- 
determination principles to the Germans that they had applied 
to themselves and to the rest of Europe, there would have been 
no error to correct. And to his point, Germany’s armies crossed 
into Austria unopposed and were greeted, in at least some places, 
enthusiastically.

After the annexation of Austria, Hitler turned his attention 
to a second of the anomalous boundaries of post–World War I 
Europe: the “Sudetenland.” The northern and western bound-
aries of Czechoslovakia followed the boundaries of the medieval 
Kingdom of Bohemia, and included a mountainous region that 
was the location of all the Czech frontier defenses. It was also 
heavily  populated  by  German  speakers.  A  percentage  of  them 
cried oppression and demanded annexation by Germany, which 
funded their campaign of complaints.

The British government had commitments to defend France; 
the French government had commitments to defend the territo-
rial integrity of Czechoslovakia; Czechoslovakia had no desire to 
surrender its mountain territories—and its frontier defenses. And 
yet the British and French governments had no desire to go to 
war to prevent the people of the Sudetenland from becoming part 
of Germany. The Western democracies’ military advisers feared 
that World War II would bring the horrors of the World War I 
trench line to civilians located far from the front.

They would be proven right.
To avoid war, on September 29–30, 1938, British prime min-
ister  Neville  Chamberlain  and  French  prime  minister  Édouard 
Daladier  went  to  Munich  and  reached  an  agreement  with  
Hitler: Hitler would annex the Sudetenland and pledge to respect 
the independence of the rest of Czechoslovakia, and Britain and 
France  would  guarantee  the  independence  of  Czechoslovakia. 
The  Czech  representatives  were  not  even  allowed  in  the  room 
where the negotiations took place.5

A cheering crowd applauded Chamberlain on his return to 
Britain. War had been averted. Irretrievably blackening his rep-
utation for all time, Chamberlain declared he had secured “peace 
with  honour.  I  believe  it  is  peace  for  our  time.”6  Churchill—
shunned by the other conservative members of the British House 
of Commons—had a very different view: “I think we shall have 
to choose in the next few weeks between war and shame, and I 
have very little doubt what the decision will be,” he had written 
to ex–prime minister David Lloyd George in advance of Cham-
berlain’s visit to Munich.7

Hitler annexed all of Czechoslovakia, after first having spon-
sored a secessionist movement in the “Slovakia” part of the country, 
on March 15, 1939. Britain and France took no action. Cham-
berlain  stated,  “The  effect  of  this  declaration  [of  independence 
by  the  Hitler-sponsored  secessionist  movement]  put  an  end  by 
internal disruption to the state whose frontiers we had proposed 
to guarantee [at Munich]. His Majesty’s government cannot ac-
cordingly hold themselves any longer bound by this obligation.”8
But within two days, Chamberlain reversed himself. Not as 

regards Czechoslovakia, but as regards appeasement.

Chamberlain and company extended security guarantees to 
Poland and Romania. German attacks on Poland or Romania, he 
publicly declared, would cause declarations of war against Ger-
many  by  Britain  and  France.  Chamberlain  appeared  to  believe 
that this commitment would deter Hitler from further adventures.

But why should it? How could British troops and warships 
help Poland in a war with the nation, Nazi Germany, that sepa-
rated the two? Hitler concluded that the British and French were 
bluffing. And he wanted to get himself ready for the attack east to 
do to the Slavic populations of European Russia what the United 
States had done to the Indigenous peoples who lived in North 
America. Just as had happened in America, Hitler’s hope was that 
Germany  would  come  into  ownership  of  a  huge  breadbasket, 
in this case Ukraine, which, after many different trails of tears, 
would be populated by ethnic Germans managing large, mecha-
nized farms.

In the spring of 1939 Hitler again demanded the redrawing 
of borders, this time to reclaim ethnolinguistic Germans trapped 
in a “Polish corridor” dividing Germany and the province of East 
Prussia.

Had the British and French diplomatic policy makers been 
flint-eyed realists, they would have shrugged their shoulders: Hit-
ler wants to go east? Let him go east. They would have concluded 
that a Hitler fighting a series of wars to his east was unlikely to 
cause them trouble, at least for a while. And that if Hitler at some 
point turned west, then that would be the time to deal with him.
But they did not do this. They had guaranteed Poland and 

Romania. They doubled down, betting on deterrence.

Chamberlain and his foreign minister, Lord Halifax, appear 
to have given little thought to what would happen if deterrence 
failed. They knew they did not want war. They were sure Hitler 
felt similarly. Which meant Hitler must be bluffing too, mustn’t 
he? Nobody wanted a repeat of World War I, right?

On one side were participants who were willing to come close 
to war, but who still held to the belief that nobody wanted one. 
They had, they thought, given Hitler enough diplomatic victories. 
Drawing a line would prevent a war from actually starting. On 
the other side were participants confident that war was inevitable,

preferable to the status quo, and necessary to secure manifestly 
destined “living space.” Moreover, the British and French politi-
cians had folded when their cards were strong. Why should they 
not fold when their cards were weak? Neither was in a position to 
help Poland militarily.

If  they  didn’t,  however,  Germany  might  face  a  war  on  its 
western  border,  and  it  was  for  this  reason  that  Hitler  became 
interested in a—temporary—alliance with Stalin and the Soviet 
Union.

Over the years, even while pursuing a “Popular Front” and 
“collective security” among non-fascist states to counter fascism 
in the mid-1930s, Stalin had put out feelers to Hitler. Hitler was 
not interested. Hitler became interested in a deal with Stalin only 
in 1939, when he recognized how useful Soviet neutrality would 
be for his conquest of Poland. Or at least half of it, for now. He 
and  Stalin  agreed  to  split  Poland  down  the  middle  at  the  Bug 
River. Additionally, the Soviet Union got a green light from Ger-
many to annex the three Baltic Republics of Lithuania, Latvia, 
and Estonia.

Stalin had made the mother of all miscalculations. The pact 
allowed  Hitler  to  fight  three  one-front  wars  in  succession— 
one  against  Poland,  one  against  Britain  and  France,  and  then  
one against the Soviet Union. Only by the skin of its teeth did 
the Soviet Union survive until the United States entered the war. 
US factories and logistical support kept the Soviet Red Army fed, 
fueled, wheeled, and moving, and the US Army and Air Force 
made it possible for an Anglo-American force to reenter the main 
theaters of the war. Much better for the Soviet Union to have 
fought Germany in 1939 with powerful British and French allies 
fielding armies on the continent than to face Germany’s undi-
vided attention in 1941, 1942, and the first half of 1943.

It  is  always  difficult  to  understand  Stalin,  or  indeed  any-
thing about the Stalin-ruled Soviet Union. “A riddle wrapped in

a mystery inside an enigma,” Churchill called it.9 It is possible, 
however, to guess at what the thinking inside Moscow’s Kremlin 
palace-fortress was:

Q:  What is Hitler, comrade?
A:  Hitler is a tool of the capitalists, comrade.

Q:  Why might Hitler wish to wage an aggressive war against 

the Soviet Union, comrade?

A:  To gain cheap access to our raw materials, comrade, so 
that his big-business capitalist backers can earn higher 
profits.

Q:  So what happens if we offer him as many of our raw ma-
terials as possible at an incredibly cheap price, comrade?
A:  Then he will not seek to invade, comrade. He will have 

no reason to do so.

Q:  What will happen then, comrade?
A:  What always happens in the highest stage of capitalism, 
comrade. The big capitalist powers become imperialists, 
and then they fight terrible wars over markets.

Q:  Correct. And after the war is over?
A:  We will do what we did at the end of World War I, 
comrade. We move in and expand the socialist camp.

Q:  Therefore our goal, comrade, is?
A:  To appease Hitler by providing him with all the raw 
materials he wants. And then wait for our moment, 
comrade.

Perhaps  Stalin  wrongly  anticipated  a  replay  of  World  War 
I:  trench  warfare  that  would  lead  to  a  prolonged  stalemate  on 
the Franco-German border, during which another generation of

young men would be slaughtered, another set of bourgeois coun-
tries would exhaust themselves, and another group of countries 
would  become  ripe  for  a  Moscow-led  communist  revolution. 
What is certain is that Stalin did not recognize the danger of even 
a temporary alliance with Hitler.

On one side were participants convinced that market- capitalist 
nations  were  doomed  to  violently  compete  among  themselves  
and  fail,  ultimately  hastening  the  arrival  of  a  proletarian  para-
dise; on the other side were participants convinced that a Jewish- 
Bolshevik conspiracy was an existential threat standing between 
them and the land destined to become their breadbasket.

In September 1939, Hitler and Stalin moved their armies in 

and partitioned Poland.

And it turned out that Britain and France were not bluffing.
They  carried  out  their  commitments.  Hitler  and  the  Nazi 
army attacked the Poles at dawn on September 1. That afternoon, 
the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, invited his prin-
cipal critic, Winston Churchill, to join the War Cabinet. He then 
ignored Churchill for two full days. I do not think anyone alive 
knows the decision-making process, but fifty hours after the Nazi 
attack—at 9:00 a.m. on September 3—the British government 
demanded that the German army withdraw from Poland. And 
at 11:00 a.m., Britain declared war. France followed. But their 
forces  were  not  ready  and  were  far  from  Poland,  which  fell  to 
Hitler and Stalin in a month.

And  while  they  had  not  been  bluffing,  they  had  not  pre-
cisely been preparing, either. They had no plans for waging a war 
against Germany. And they did not develop any. And so for eight 
months after the fall of Poland all was quiet on the western front.
It is conventional to damn Chamberlain and Daladier and the 
other politicians who ruled Britain and France in the 1930s for 
their actions and inactions. They had not destroyed Hitler when 
he was weak. They had not prepared their countries to fight Hit-
ler when he was strong. They had not even constructed a grand

alliance,  calling  on  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  in 
an anti-fascist coalition. That all evidence suggests that neither 
country’s decision makers wished to be so enlisted doesn’t moot 
the failure of not bothering to try.

But there is another point of view. Only one country with a 
land border with Nazi Germany, Daladier’s France, declared war 
on it. Everybody else waited until Hitler declared war on them—
or, more often, just attacked. In the case of Stalin’s Russia, being 
attacked had been preceded by the Soviet’s signing, and mostly 
adhering  to,  a  nonaggression  pact.  Only  one  other  country  in 
the 1930s, albeit one without a land border with Nazi Germany, 
ever declared war on it. That country was Chamberlain’s Brit-
ain. Admittedly, the British declared war only when they saw no 
other option, and thought (correctly) that their political survival 
was at stake. And they had no idea how to fight the war that they 
declared. But they were willing to put their empire and its people 
in harm’s way in an attempt to stamp out the greatest tyranny 
the world had ever seen. Spare a moment for the limited virtue 
that Édouard Daladier and Neville Chamberlain exhibited: it was 
more than anybody else.

Their virtue was not rewarded.
In  six  weeks  starting  on  May  10,  1940,  France  fell.10  The  
Nazis then enforced the surrender of France, and chased the Brit-
ish army off the continent at the port of Dunkirk, where it left 
all its equipment behind. To everyone’s surprise, however, Brit-
ain—by then led by Winston Churchill—did not then negotiate 
a peace. It kept fighting, daring Hitler to try an invasion across 
the English Channel. Hitler did not try. He sent fleets of bombers 
by day in 1940, and afterward sent fleets of bombers by night.  
He  aggressively  funded  Wernher  von  Braun’s  rocket-building 
program, producing the “V” series of terror-vengeance weapons 
in 1944.11

But after the fall of French he turned his armies east, as he had 
always intended he would. On June 22, 1941, Hitler launched

the  Nazi  army  against  the  Soviet  Union.  But  he  had  not  fully 
mobilized the economy and society for a total war. He attacked 
with what he had on hand.

Stalin’s first instinct was to tell his troops not to fire back, 
for fear of “provoking” the Nazis. As a result, the Soviet air force 
was  destroyed  on  the  ground  in  the  first  day  of  the  war.  And  
the Soviet armies on the border died (or were taken prisoner) 
where they stood. Stalin’s vices proved costly.

Stalin  had  purged  and  repurged  the  army  of  anyone  he 
thought might be a threat. He had built a system in which it was 
a  career-  and  often  a  life-threatening  move  to  be  the  bearer  of 
disappointing tidings. When the Nazis attacked, the Red Army 
deployed out of the defenses it had constructed before 1939. It 
had not yet fully deployed its defenses for the border after the 
partition of Poland. And so the USSR lost an entire army, as large 
as and as well equipped (but not nearly as well trained or capable) 
as the army the Nazis had attacked with in late June, July, and 
early August 1941 in battles around Riga, Brest-Litovsk, Lvov, 
and elsewhere near the border.

By August 1941, however, the Nazis had outrun their sup-
ply lines and paused their advance. Stalin and the USSR’s high 
command  (the  Stavka)  misjudged  the  situation  and  lost  a  sec-
ond army, as large and as well equipped (but not nearly as well 
trained or capable) as the army the Nazis had attacked with in late  
August, September, and early October in the battles around Smo-
lensk and Kiev, as they tried to push forward in counterattacks, 
refusing to withdraw. Thus, in the four months after the Nazi in-
vasion of Russia, nearly four million Soviet troops were captured. 
And the Nazis attacked again. By December 7, 1941, coinciding 
with America’s entry into World War II, Nazi armies were at the 
gates of the cities of Leningrad, Moscow, Kharkov, and Rostov, 
an average of 620 miles east of the 1941 Nazi-Soviet border.

But the USSR had a third army, as large as, but this time not 
as well equipped as, the one the Nazis had attacked with. This

army held, and counterattacked, and fought the battles of the fall 
and winter of 1941–1942.12

WHEN  THE  UNITED  STATES  entered  World  War  II—rather, 
when it was pushed into it (for, remember, no countries save Da-
ladier’s France and Chamberlain’s Britain deliberately entered the 
war against Hitler), on December 7, 1941, by the Imperial Jap-
anese Navy’s Kido Butai, its six large-carrier mobile strike force, 
and its attack on Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu—
the War in the Pacific was already in its fifth year. It had com-
menced with Japan’s 1937 invasion of China.

World War II in Europe is hard to imagine without World 
War I. This is so at the macro level: World War I’s economic, 
political, and human devastation rent the fabric of European sta-
bility and prosperity. It is also so at the micro level: the normal 
peacetime course of human events would never have given a Sta-
lin and a Hitler the opportunities they seized. The same was true 
for the other side of the globe. World War I and the Great De-
pression gave powerful nudges to Japan in its turn to imperialism.
World  War  I  was  a  powerful  indirect  stimulus  to  Japanese 
industrialization. During hostilities, exports from Europe to Asia 
effectively ceased. Where were the countries of Asia to purchase 
the manufactures they had previously received from Europe? The 
growing  and  industrializing  Japanese  Empire  was  an  obvious 
source.  Industrial  production  and  manufactured  exports  from 
Japan nearly quadrupled during World War I. Strong demand 
for Japanese goods provoked inflation: prices more than doubled 
during the European conflict.

After the war, European economies once again began to ex-
port to Asia, and the newly expanded Japanese industries faced 
heavy competition. The Japanese economy was also badly affected 
by the disastrous 1923 Tokyo earthquake, in which between fifty 
thousand and one hundred thousand people died. But despite all

this, Japanese industrialization continued. In the 1920s, manu-
facturing surpassed agriculture in value-added products.

Japanese manufacturing originally relied—as had manufactur-
ing in other countries—on unmarried young women. From the 
employers’ point of view, the main problem with this workforce 
was its relative lack of experience and high rate of turnover. So, 
over the first half of the twentieth century, Japanese manufacturers 
worked to balance their short-term labor pool of unmarried female 
workers with a longer-term cadre of experienced male workers.

What  evolved  was  what  is  now  called  the  “permanent  em-
ployment system.” Japanese male workers were recruited on leav-
ing school, or as apprentices, and promised lifetime employment, 
with wage increases, medical care, and pension benefits, in return 
for loyal service to the company. It is possible that this permanent 
employment system flourished in Japan because it fitted Japanese 
society well. It is also possible that by avoiding deep recessions, 
the Japanese economy avoided conditions that might have given 
manufacturing firms cause to fire workers.

Cotton textiles, furniture manufacturing, apparel, and a rela-
tively small heavy industrial sector were the heart of the Japanese 
economy by the 1930s. This modern manufacturing sector was 
dominated  by  the  zaibatsu:  associations  of  businesses  that  ex-
changed  executives,  cooperated,  owned  each  other’s  stock,  and 
relied on the same banking and insurance companies for finance. 
Japan’s form of financial capitalism seemed to mimic Germany’s 
to a large degree.

The Great Depression came to Japan in an attenuated form 
in 1930. Its exports, especially of silk, fell dramatically. Adhering 
to the gold standard applied pressure that deflated the Japanese 
economy. Japan responded by cutting loose from the gold stan-
dard and by expanding government spending—especially military 
spending.  The  Great  Depression  touched  but  did  not  stun  the 
Japanese economy. More important, perhaps, the Great Depres-
sion revealed that the European imperialist powers were in crisis.

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

So, in 1931, the Japanese government turned expansionist. 
The  extension  of  Japanese  influence  into  Manchuria  was  fol-
lowed  by  a  Manchurian  declaration  of  “independence”  as  the 
Japanese client state of Manchukuo. Expansion was followed by 
rearmament. Rearmament was followed by a full-scale attack on 
China in 1937. Government orders for war material and for cap-
ital  goods  to  construct  infrastructure  in  Manchuria  provided  a 
strong boost to Japanese industrial production. Japan embraced 
a war economy from 1937 on, building warships, airplanes, en-
gines, radios, tanks, and machine guns.

But  in  order  to  continue  its  war  against  China,  it  needed 
oil, which would have to come either from the United States or 
from what was to become Indonesia (it was then the Dutch East 
Indies). President Franklin Roosevelt was anxious to exert what 
pressure he could to contain the expanding Japanese Empire. So, 
on July 25, 1941, the day after the Japanese army occupied the 
southern  half  of  Indochina,  Roosevelt  directed  that  all  known 
Japanese financial assets in the United States be frozen.

The  Japanese  government  obtained  bureaucratic  licenses  to 
buy oil in the United States and ship it to Japan. But how were 
they  to  pay?  Their  assets  were  blocked  by  the  freeze.  Requests 
from  the  Japanese  government  for  the  release  of  funds  to  pay 
for the oil went into Assistant Secretary of State Dean Acheson’s 
office, but nothing ever came out. Bureaucracy? Policy? And, if 
policy, whose? It is unclear whether Roosevelt or the Army and 
Navy Departments were ever told before December 7 that the 
asset  freeze  had  turned  into  a  de  facto  oil  embargo—one  that 
extended to oil from what is now Indonesia as well, as the Dutch 
colonial authorities insisted on being paid in dollars.

So  the  United  States,  with  its  asset  freeze,  had  essentially 
embargoed exports of oil to Japan—all oil, not just oil from the 
United States. Without imports of oil Japan’s military machine 
could not run. The embargo offered Japan a choice between ac-
quiescing to the United States’ demands or starting a war to, at

the very least, seize the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies. That 
was  predictable,  and  should  have  been  predicted,  and  then  re-
sponded to. The response should have been a much higher level 
of alert in the Pacific than was in fact adopted by the US Army 
and Navy.

Faced with a choice that its leaders perceived as no choice at 
all,  the  Japanese  military  elected  to  strike  first  and  strike  hard. 
On December 7, 1941, attacks began on British, Dutch, and US 
forces and possessions in the Pacific. Most famous was the Japa-
nese attack on Pearl Harbor sinking the battleships of the US Pa-
cific Fleet. But most damaging was the attack on the US airbase of 
Clark Field in the Philippines, which destroyed the B-17 bomber 
force that might have blocked Japanese seaborne invasions.

If not for the Imperial Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, fol-
lowed immediately by Adolf Hitler’s declaration of war against 
the United States, it is very difficult to see how the United States 
would  have  entered  World  War  II.  US  public  opinion  in  late 
1941 favored giving Britain and the Soviets enough weapons to 
fight Hitler to the last man, but keeping American boys out of 
the fray. If that opinion had continued to take precedence in US 
policy, history might have turned out very differently indeed,

The range of World War II belligerents expanded and con-
tracted. In Europe the war began as France, Britain, and Poland 
against  Nazi  Germany.  Nazi  Germany  and  Soviet  Russia  con-
quered Poland by the end of September 1939. The Soviets at-
tacked Finland, which in the winter and spring of 1940 fought 
it to a draw and a peace. The spring of 1940 also saw Germany 
attack and occupy Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Luxembourg,  and  France,  with  Italy  joining  in  on  Germany’s 
side. By the summer of 1940 only Britain was fighting Nazi Ger-
many. In late 1940 and early 1941 Britain acquired Greece and 
Yugoslavia as allies. But they were conquered by Nazi Germany 
by the spring of 1941. In the summer of 1941 Nazi Germany 
attacked Soviet Russia. And on December 7, 1941, the Japanese

navy attacked a wide range of US, British, and Dutch territories 
in the Pacific. Nazi Germany declared war on the United States 
a day later. (But, curiously enough, Japan remained at peace with 
Soviet Russia.) At that point, the war was truly global.

It was a “total war.” At its peak, some 40 percent of the US 
gross  domestic  product  was  being  devoted  to  the  war.  Some  
60  percent  of  British  GDP  was  devoted  to  the  war.  Some  60  
million—plus or minus 10 million—people died in, during, and 
as a result of the war.

How are we to understand World War II?
Consider death only.
When World War II ended, perhaps 45 million in Europe 
and 15 million in Asia were dead by violence or starvation. More 
than half of that number were inhabitants of the Soviet Union. 
But even west of the post–World War II Soviet border, perhaps 
one in twenty were killed. In Central Europe that number was 
close to one in twelve. During World War I, the overwhelming 
proportion of those killed had been soldiers. During World War 
II, well under half of those killed were soldiers. Raw numbers do 
no justice, but carry the point with the following tally of deaths:

European Jews: 6 million (70 percent) (one-third of  

them Poles)

Poland: 6 million (16 percent) (one-third of them Jews)
Soviet Union: 26 million (13 percent)
Germany: 8 million (10 percent)
Japan: 2.7 million (4 percent)
China: 10 million (2 percent)
France: 600,000 (1 percent)
Italy: 500,000 (1 percent)
Britain: 400,000 (1 percent)
United States: 400,000 (0.3 percent)

World War II

To help explain the course of the war, we can first look at it 
tactically and operationally. Consider the first three major cam-
paigns—the  Polish  campaign  of  September  1939,  the  French 
campaign of May and June 1940, and the first six months of the 
Russian campaign, from June 22 to the end of 1941.

In the 1939 Polish campaign, the Nazis lost 40,000 soldiers 
killed and wounded. The Poles lost 200,000 killed and wounded. 
The Poles also lost about 1 million taken prisoner. In the 1940 
French  campaign,  the  Nazis  lost  160,000  soldiers  killed  and 
wounded. The Allies lost 360,000 soldiers killed and wounded. 
And  the  Allies  also  lost  2  million  soldiers  taken  prisoner.  In  
the  first  six  months  of  the  1941  Russian  campaign,  the  Nazis 
lost  1  million  soldiers  killed  and  wounded.  The  Russians  lost 
4  million  soldiers  killed  and  wounded.  And  the  Russians  lost  
4 million soldiers taken prisoner.

The  Nazis  were  simply  better,  tactically,  at  the  business  of 
war than any of their enemies. They understood dive bombers, 
they  understood  tank  columns,  and  they  understood  surprise 
and flank attacks and digging in. The interwar German army on 
which the Nazis had built had had only 100,000 soldiers. But 
those 100,000 soldiers had learned and developed their business 
to a terrifying degree of tactical superiority. That is the first les-
son of World War II: Fight the Nazis and expect to be tactically 
outclassed. Expect to lose between two and five times as many 
soldiers on the battlefield as the Nazi armies do. That was true for 
everyone at the start of the war, and it was still true remarkably 
late into the war—even though the Allies did learn.

Moreover,  the  Nazis’  opponents  were  operationally  out-
classed.  Hence  the  second  lesson  of  World  War  II:  Fight  the 
Nazis  and  expect  periodically  to  find  large  groups  of  your  sol-
diers overwhelmed, surrounded, cut off, out of supplies, fleeing 
in panic, and forced to surrender in large numbers. The last such 
episode took place in December 1944, less than five months be-
fore the collapse of the Nazi regime, when the Nazi Fifth Panzer

Army  surrounded  nearly  the  entire  106th  Infantry  Division  of 
the US Army in the Snowy Mountains of the Ardennes Forest on 
the Belgian-German border, forcing it to surrender.

Simply  put,  tactical  and  operational  superiority  matters 

immensely.

Consider again the French campaign of 1940. The French are 
expecting the Nazis to attack through Belgium north of the Ar-
dennes Forest. Instead, the Nazis make their main attack through 
the Ardennes Forest itself, against the weak French Ninth Army—
weak because the French command thought that the forest, the 
poor road network, and the Meuse River would be sufficient ad-
ditional defenses.

Three days into the 1940 battle it was clear that a major Nazi 
attack was coming through the Ardennes, and the French began 
to respond. According to Ernest May’s Strange Victory, they did 
so robustly. He reported that at 3:00 p.m. on May 12, the French 
general Charles Huntziger ordered “strong reinforcements to re-
pel a prospective German attack.” What May called “three of the 
strongest elements in the general reserve” then joined Huntziger’s 
Second Army: the Third Armored, the Third Motorized, and the 
Fourteenth Infantry Divisions. “The infantry division was a crack 
unit,” May wrote.13

By May 15, these three divisions had been further reinforced: 
The French First Armored Division had been switched from the 
Belgian plain to the Ninth Army sector to its south; infantry for-
mations had been ordered to assemble behind the Ninth Army to 
form a new Sixth Army; and the Second Armored Division had 
been ordered to assemble behind Ninth Army as well. Charles 
de Gaulle, placed in command of the newly formed Fourth Ar-
mored Division, was ordered to attack the southern flank of the 
incipient Nazi German breakthrough.

So  what  happened  to  all  these  forces—four  heavy  armored 
divisions, with perhaps eight hundred tanks between them, plus 
a large chunk of the sixteen infantry divisions that were in the

French strategic reserve? Before hearing the answer, consider that 
the French had as many tanks in their four armored divisions as 
the Nazis had in their seven panzer divisions that were in the Nazi 
main thrust.

Here’s what happened.
The  French  First  Armored  Division  simply  ran  out  of  gas. 
While  it  was  waiting  for  the  fuel  trucks  to  replenish  its  tanks, 
General Erwin Rommel’s Seventh Panzer Division came down 
the  road.  Seizing  the  opportunity,  Rommel  attacked  and  de-
stroyed the French First Armored. For want of fuel, it was wiped 
off the board as a fighting unit.

The  French  Second  Armored  Division  was  ineffective  be-
cause its assembly areas had been overrun by the Nazis before it 
could even begin to fight. According to William L. Shirer’s The 
Collapse of the Third Republic, “orders for the [Second Armored] 
Division to move . . . did not come until noon of May 13,” and 
“the trains with the tanks and artillery were not able to start until 
the afternoon of the 14th.” Then, “the wheeled vehicles with the 
supplies ran into the panzers” and had to withdraw, as they had 
“no combat elements.” By the time the tanks and tracked artil-
lery were ready, “between Saint Quentin and Hirson,” they were 
“hopelessly dispersed over a large triangle.”14

Huntziger  ordered  the  French  Third  Armored  Division  to 
retreat to the south, judging that its principal task should be to 
guard the left flank against an attack if the Nazis turned south 
after crossing the Meuse River. The infantry formations of the 
French Sixth Army, like the French Second Armored Division, 
were overrun by General Georg-Hans Reinhardt’s Sixth Panzer 
Division on May 15 and 16 while they were trying to organize 
themselves.

By  May  16,  as  Shirer  put  it,  France’s  three  heavy  armored 
divisions, “all of which on May 10 had been stationed . . . within  
50 miles of the Meuse at Sedan and Mezieres, which they could  
have reached by road overnight, had thus been squandered. . . .

Not  one  had  been  properly  deployed.”  They  were  now  out  of  
the action.

When  the  Nazis  had  attacked  on  May  10,  the  French  had 
had only three armored divisions. On May 11, the French high 
command ordered an annoying and arrogant colonel, Charles de 
Gaulle, to form and take command of the Fourth Armored Di-
vision. On the 17th he led what troops he had in an attack that 
at least caused the Nazi spearheads some hours of uncertainty. 
De Gaulle’s Fourth Armored Division did make its weight felt 
on the battlefield. But, as Shirer noted, that division “was below 
strength and without divisional training.”15 When France fell, de 
Gaulle did not surrender, but instead declared that he himself was 
the leader of France—Free France: “The flame of French resis-
tance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.”16 
Somehow, he made it stick, and the “Free French,” armed with 
American weapons, fought with the Allies until 1945.

The French failed in tactics—the comparative battlefield ca-
sualties make that clear. The French failed in strategy—by op-
posing the main Nazi attack with the weak Ninth Army while 
leaving  the  stronger  formations  to  the  north,  where  they  were 
vulnerable to encirclement. And the French failed in operations.
On May 10, Churchill had left his job as First Lord of the  
Admiralty, kissed the hands of the king, and taken over as First 
Lord  of  the  Treasury,  replacing  Chamberlain  as  leader  of  the 
British Empire. Five days later he received a phone call from the 
French prime minister, Paul Reynaud: “We have been defeated. 
We are beaten. We have lost the battle. The road to Paris is open. 
We are defeated,” Reynaud told him.

On  May  16,  Churchill  crossed  the  English  Channel.  The 
flight to the Paris airport took just over an hour. It became im-
mediately clear that the situation was dire, far more dire than he 
had understood before boarding the flight. The French general 
Maurice Gamelin explained the situation in simple, stark terms, 
which Churchill recorded in his memoir:

North and south of Sedan, on a front of fifty or sixty miles, the 
Germans had broken through. The French army in front of 
them was destroyed or scattered. A heavy onrush of armoured 
vehicles  was  advancing  with  unheard-of  speed. . . . Behind 
the armour, he said, eight or ten German divisions, all mo-
torized, were driving onwards, making flanks for themselves 
as they advanced against the two disconnected French armies 
on either side.17

THE  GERMANS,  GENERAL  GAMELIN  stated,  were  expected  in 
Paris in a few days. Gobsmacked, Churchill asked, in clear En-
glish and poor French, about the French Army’s strategic reserve:

General Gamelin turned to me and, with a shake of the head 
and a shrug, said “Aucune” [None]. . . . I was dumbfounded. 
What were we to think of the great French Army and its high-
est chiefs? . . . One can have, one must always have, a mass 
of  divisions  which  marches  up  in  vehement  counter-attack 
at the moment when the first fury of the offensive has spent 
its force. . . . I admit this was one of the greatest surprises I 
have had in my life. . . . Presently I asked General Gamelin 
when  and  where  he  proposed  to  attack. . . . His  reply  was   
“Inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority 
of method”—and then a hopeless shrug of the shoulders.18

CHURCHILL WAS WRONG: THE French had possessed a strategic 
reserve. It had been committed, and it had been ground up in a 
week.  Systemic  failures  in  tactics,  strategy,  and  operations  had 
rendered it ineffective in combat, dooming France.

Before  we  scorn  the  French  army  of  1940  as  cheese-eating 
surrender monkeys, remember what happened to the US 106th 
Infantry Division when Hitler’s Third Reich was on its very last 
legs. The same had happened to Major General Lloyd Freden-
dall’s US II Corps at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, in the US forces’

first encounter with the Nazi army on the attack. Everybody—
the  Poles,  the  Dutch,  the  Belgians,  the  French,  the  Yugoslavs, 
the Greeks, the British, the Americans, and the Russians—who 
faced  the  Nazis  failed  more  or  less  equally,  both  tactically  and 
operationally, at least in their initial encounters, and in no small 
number of subsequent encounters.

The tactical and operational superiority of the Nazi armies was 
a powerful force multiplier. Fortunately for the world and for the 
Allies, it was offset by equally large strategic deficits. Consider the 
high-water mark of Nazi conquest in Europe, November 1942. 
The Nazis had thirteen of their field army formations in Russia, 
between the Baltic Sea to the northwest and the Black and Cas-
pian Seas to the south and southeast. Eight of those were spread 
out  in  a  line  extending  from  what  was  then  Leningrad  on  the 
Baltic Sea south-southeast to the city of Voronezh on the Don, 
the middle one of European Russia’s three great southern rivers, 
three-fifths of the way from the Baltic Sea (on which Leningrad 
sat) to the Caspian Sea. Then there was a gap. Then there were 
two armies where the Don and Volga Rivers nearly touched, half-
way from Voronezh to the Caspian. That is where the city then 
called Stalingrad was located. And there were three more armies 
much farther to the southeast, in the Caucasus Mountains.

Why were those five armies in the southeast—the two grind-
ing the city of Stalingrad to rubble, and the three in the Cauca-
sus—extended so far from the rest? What were they doing? And 
what was the gap between them and the rest of the Nazi German 
army? The answer for the three southernmost is that they were 
trying to conquer the Caucasus oil fields. Hitler and his staff were 
convinced that Nazi Germany could not continue the war unless 
they controlled more oil fields than the Romanian ones around 
Ploesti.

As it happens, they were wrong. Subordinates were lying to 
superiors  about  how  much  fuel  they  had  and  how  much  they 
were using. One of the defects of command-and-control central

planning is that you are increasingly beholden to the honesty of 
subordinates, who are increasingly encouraged to fall on the side 
of conservative speculation, rather than being called out for fail-
ing  to  plan  adequately.  In  any  case,  Hitler  was  convinced  that 
everything must be risked to conquer the oil fields.

The two armies, the German Sixth Army and the German 
Fourth  Panzer  Army,  near  the  banks  of  the  Don  and  Volga  
Rivers, were guarding the left flank of the three armies committed 
to  the  Caucasus.  Both  were  also  expending  men  and  materials 
and  precious  time  trying  to  capture  the  bombed-out  wreckage 
that had been the city of Stalingrad.

It’s unclear why—other than that the city was named after 
the Soviet Russian dictator. Capture of Stalingrad and the Volga 
River banks on which it sat would not provide better flank pro-
tection for the armies farther south than a position back at Kalach 
on the Don River. And the Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army 
ought to have been worrying about their own flanks, for between 
them and Voronezh were only badly trained and poorly equipped 
soldiers from Italy and Germany’s less-than-enthusiastic allies in 
the Balkans.

The USSR had avoided losing the third tranche of the Red 
Army—that which had fought in the late fall and winter of 1941–
1942,  plus  reinforcements—in  the  summer  and  fall  of  1942. 
They had been mauled. They had fallen back—unwillingly—in 
front of the Nazi offensive. They had, however, avoided destruc-
tion via mass encirclements and surrenders, like those of 1941. 
And,  meanwhile,  scraping  the  bottom  of  their  manpower  bar-
rel—and relying on a combination of Lend-Lease supplies and 
the armaments factories that Aleksei Kosygin’s team had evacu-
ated from in front of the Nazi advance, and moved to safety in 
the  east19—they  had  built  a  fourth  tranche  of  their  army  with 
which to launch winter offensives.

The Soviets attempted two great offensives in the winter of 
1942–1943. Operation Mars was directed against the center of

the Nazi line, near Moscow. It was a failure, with heavy casualties. 
Operation  Uranus  was  directed  against  the  long  exposed  Nazi 
flanks near Stalingrad. It was a total and overwhelming success, 
pulling off a grand encirclement and a grand surrender by sur-
rounding and capturing the entire German Sixth Army (and large 
chunks of the Fourth Panzer Army as well) and forcing a precipi-
tous withdrawal of the Nazi forces farther south away from the oil 
fields and back toward Germany. It was an extraordinary victory, 
and one made possible only by the extraordinary strategic lapses 
that had ordered the Nazi eastern front forces to their dispersed 
positions in late 1942.

The Red Army might thus have grasped the last chance for 
the Allies to win a victory in World War II that did not require 
reducing German to a radioactive wasteland. If Operation Ura-
nus at Stalingrad had failed as did Operation Mars in front of 
Moscow, and if the fourth tranche of the Red Army had, like 
its three predecessors, also been ground up into ineffectiveness 
in the months after its deployment, would Stalin have been able 
to raise a fifth? Or would that have been the end of the Soviet 
Union?

Whereas the Allies could afford strategic lapses, in the sense 
of paying the butcher’s bill and keeping in the fight, the Nazis 
could not. Not while they were fighting a total war on several 
fronts across an entire continent (and to varying degrees across 
several of the planet’s oceans). Consider the number of German 
troops killed or missing month by month from the start of 1941 
to the end of 1944. From the start of Russian theater operations 
in June 1941 on, with occasional pauses, the Nazis lost, killed or 
missing, about 50,000 German soldiers every month. At the start 
of the war, Nazi Germany had an ethnic German population of 
about 60 million, with perhaps 15 million men of military age. 
Half of those could be mobilized. The other half were needed for 
war work, though these men could have been moved to various 
fronts, if the Nazis had been willing to go against their ideology

and mobilize women on a large scale, which they were not. With 
a maximum potential army strength of only 7.5 million, steadily 
losing 50,000 each month is a heavy drain.

Then comes a 250,000 spike in December 1942 through Feb-
ruary 1943. This mass loss of manpower caused the surrender of the 
Sixth Army at Stalingrad. A smaller spike in late spring followed, 
causing the surrender of the Nazi army group in Tunisia. A year 
later, in the summer of 1944, there was a 1-million-soldier spike 
during the collapse and surrender of the Nazi Army Group Center 
under the impact of Soviet Russia’s offensive Operation Bagration.
Better Nazi strategy that did not undermine Germany’s tacti-
cal and operational edge would have prolonged the war. Perhaps it 
would have allowed Germany to win it: a Germany that picked its 
enemies sequentially and fought each until it was defeated would 
have been much more dangerous than a Germany that attacked 
Soviet Russia while still fighting a war with Britain, and that then 
declared war on the United States on December 8, 1941.

But  Germany  probably  would  still  not  have  won  the  war. 
Even the best strategy, coupled with Germany’s operational and 
tactical advantages, would have been unlikely to make up for the 
logistical and productivity differentials. They were just too great.
Set  war  production  of  the  United  States  in  1944  equal  to 
100. By this metric, in 1940 Britain’s production is 7 and Nazi 
Germany’s and Japan’s is 11. In 1942, all the Allies together are 
producing 92, and Germany and Japan are producing 16. And by 
1944, it is 150 to 24.

From 1942 on, once the war had become truly global, Hit-
ler’s defeat was nearly inevitable. Even Britain alone was match-
ing Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe in war production. 
Throw in the United States and the Soviet Union, and Nazi Ger-
many was outproduced more than eight to one. Nazi Germany 
and Japan together were outproduced more than six to one.

A  three-to-one  tactical-operational  advantage  in  casualties 
does not help when you are outnumbered in tanks and aircraft

eight to one, and outnumbered in potential military manpower 
ten to one. Starting in the fall of 1942, a large number of import-
ant battles went against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan: The 
Battle of Midway northwest of Hawaii. The Battle of Guadalca-
nal. The Battle of El Alamein in Egypt. The years-long Battle of 
the Atlantic. And most of all, the Battle of Stalingrad and Opera-
tion Uranus. By the end of all this it was very clear who would win 
the war, if the Nazis elected to keep on fighting. Ideology dictated 
that they must, so they did. It was not, said Churchill in Novem-
ber 1942, the end. It was not even, said Churchill, the beginning 
of the end. But it was the end of the beginning. He was right.

In the spring of 1945, US, British, and Russian forces met 
in the rubble that had been Germany. In his bunker in Berlin 
Adolf Hitler committed suicide as the Russians closed in on his 
command post. And even if the armies of these nations had not 
proven  victorious  on  the  battlefield,  there  was  the  Manhattan 
Project and the atomic bomb. Japan, atom-bombed, firebombed, 
blockaded,  and  threatened  with  invasion,  surrendered  in  the 
summer of 1945.

Might science have offered the Nazis an escape hatch? No. 
When Hitler took power, Germany had the best atomic phys-
icists in the world. But what they did was dismissed as “Jewish 
science.”  The  lucky  were  able  to  flee  into  exile,  some  making 
their way to the United States and England, where they lent their 
knowledge to defeating the Nazis.

The Nazis had no atom bombs; nor did they know how to 
build any. In contrast, starting in August 1945, the United States 
had the power to turn cities, starting at two for the first month, 
into radioactive wastelands. And the United States would have 
used that power until unconditional surrender was offered. We 
know this because that is what it did.

World War II was, in an utterly insufficient word, horrid. A 
number of scholars have observed that it was all avoidable. Had

the  British  and  French  governments  been  willing  to  use  force 
to remove Hitler when he occupied the Rhineland in 1936, or 
when he threatened Czechoslovakia in 1938, there would have 
been no World War II in Europe. Had Stalin allied with Britain 
and France and declared war on Nazi Germany when Hitler in-
vaded Poland in 1939, in all probability Hitler would have been 
crushed much sooner, and World War II in Europe would have 
ended by the end of 1941.

Perhaps. Such speculation turns more on individuals than un-

derlying facts, either of ideology or of economy.

Or suppose Franklin D. Roosevelt had decided, in the spring 
of 1941, that with Europe ablaze it was unwise to try to use an 
economic embargo of militarily necessary oil to pressure Japan 
to  withdraw  from  China.  Perhaps  even  by  1945  the  United 
States  and  Japan  would  have  been  at  peace,  the  coastal  prov-
inces of China would have been Japanese-occupied colonies, an-
archy would have reigned in China’s interior, and the Japanese 
military would have enjoyed great prestige for establishing this 
co-prosperity.

Had anyone other than Winston Churchill become British 
prime minister in 1940—had Neville Chamberlain remained, or 
had Lord Halifax assumed the post—then the British government 
would almost surely have negotiated a separate peace with Nazi 
Germany in 1940. When Nazi Germany attacked Soviet Russia 
in 1941, it would have done so with its full strength. Stalin’s re-
gime might well have collapsed, and European Russia up to the 
Urals (and perhaps beyond) could have become a Nazi German 
territory, colony, or puppet state.

It is not likely that Hitler would have refrained from attacking 
Russia in any possible universe. The need to do so was buried 
too deeply in his ideological worldview. It is only slightly more 
plausible to think that Hitler might not have declared war on the 
United States in 1941.

Except Roosevelt, and Churchill, and Stalin, and Hitler, and 
Emperor Hirohito, were who they were, and that made a differ-
ence—perhaps the difference.

We  do  know  that  most  of  the  alternative  ways  that  World 
War  II  might  have  gone  would  trade  a  postwar  period  with  a 
communist evil empire, centered in Moscow and dominant over 
Eastern  Europe,  for  a  postwar  period  with  a  Nazi  evil  empire, 
centered in Berlin and dominant over all of Europe, or perhaps 
Eurasia. Not an improvement.

What the world confronted after the surrenders were accepted 
was  very  different  from  those  alternatives:  a  defeated,  ruined 
Germany; a victorious, ruined Russia; a defeated, ruined, and in 
places radioactive Japan; various paths of destruction crisscrossing 
Europe; a victorious, but exhausted, British Empire; and a victo-
rious, territorially unscathed, economically dominant, and newly 
confident United States. The world was thus very different from 
what anyone could have forecast back in 1933, or even 1938.

The Cold War of Hostile  
Yet Coexisting Systems

M ilitarism and imperialism, racial and cultural rivalries—

those  had  played  the  serpent  to  the  pre-1914  Belle  
Époque  era  of  largely  peaceful  progressive  prosperity.  After 
World War II these serpents were still out there slithering, and 
they soon took huge and nightmarish shape in the form of the 
US-Soviet Cold War.

Yet, paradoxically, the Cold War did not block or even hob-
ble  human  progress  toward  prosperity  and  utopia.  Rather,  the 
Cold War seems more likely to have accelerated it.

Why isn’t obvious. Indeed, on several occasions the Cold War 
veered  toward  a  decidedly  worse  outcome.  It  teetered  and  tot-
tered toward various brinks, including the brink. The Cold War 
blossomed violently on occasion. It expended vast resources on 
developing means of annihilation and extinction. It could have 
gone very badly.1

But it also kept other sources of conflict from themselves hob-

bling growth and progress.

The surreal character of the Cold War is neatly captured in 
the fact that, in one sense, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, one of

Stalin’s more bloody-handed henchmen in the 1930s and 1940s, 
who ran the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1964, could be declared 
among  its  winners.  In  1959  he  wrote  about  competition  and 
the  need  for  peaceful  coexistence,  central  themes  of  US-Soviet 
rivalries:

Peaceful  coexistence  does  not  mean  merely  living  side  by 
side . . . with the constantly remaining threat of [war] break-
ing  out  in  the  future.  Peaceful  coexistence  can  and  should 
develop into peaceful competition for the purpose of satisfy-
ing man’s needs in the best possible way. . . . Let us try out 
in  practice  whose  system  is  better,  let  us  compete  without 
war.  This  is  much  better  than  competing  in  who  will  pro-
duce more arms and who will smash whom. We stand and 
always will stand for such competition as will help to raise the 
well-being of the people to a higher level. . . . We may argue, 
we may disagree with one another. The main thing is to keep 
to the positions of ideological struggle, without resorting to 
arms in order to prove that one is right. . . . Ultimately that 
system will be victorious on the globe which will offer the na-
tions greater opportunities for improving their material and 
spiritual life.2

Khrushchev—who  had  also  been  quoted  as  declaring  that 
Soviet Russia would “bury” the world’s capitalist states—would 
have been surprised that, by 1990, it was clear even to his suc-
cessors  sitting  in  the  Kremlin  that  really-existing  socialism  was 
a dead end for humanity.3 It wasn’t the case that the capitalist 
states had managed to bury the socialist states; they hadn’t. While  
the Cold War briefly flared hot—for example, in Korea and Viet-
nam—it was kept from becoming a global conflagration. What 
was more, the Cold War ended sort of the way Khrushchev had 
hoped: with one system offering clearly greater opportunities for 
improving material and spiritual life.

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

There  was  not  supposed  to  be  a  Cold  War.4  The  Allied 
powers— they called themselves the United Nations—had coop-
erated  to  destroy  the  greatest  and  most  dangerous  tyranny  the 
world had ever seen. Why could they not continue to cooperate 
to build a better world? The post–World War II world was a great 
place for new global cooperative organizations. Chief among them 
was the broadening of this wartime United Nations alliance into 
the UNO—the United Nations Organization—with its Security 
Council, its General Assembly, and all of its branches.

And again, there was not supposed to be a Cold War. Marx-
ist-Leninist theory was very clear on what was to come if World 
War II was followed by a genuine peace. Capitalism, in Lenin’s 
view, needed imperialism.5 Imperialism produced militarization, 
with its enormous demand for weapons and colonies, which of-
fered captive markets. These were essential to preserve near-full 
employment, and so stave off the catastrophic economic crises— 
like the Great Depression—that would otherwise produce com-
munist  revolution.  But  imperialism  also  produced  war.  Thus, 
capitalism was staving off revolution due to economic catastrophe 
by courting revolution due to political-military catastrophe. And 
in Lenin’s opinion, such staving off could only last so long.

As Lenin’s successors saw it, the capitalist-imperialist powers 
had successfully delayed revolution from the late 1890s though 
imperialism and militarism, but they had then fallen into the ca-
tastrophe of World War I. And that brought Lenin to power in 
Russia, and led to the creation of the first really-existing socialist 
country: the USSR. The revolution had greatly marched forward 
because of and in the aftermath of World War I.

After World War I, Lenin’s successors believed, the capital-
ists had concluded that representative institutions were no longer 
compatible with their continued rule, so they swung their support 
behind fascists: Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in Germany, Franco in 
Spain, Philippe Pétain in France, Hideki Tojo in Japan. This did 
not remove the need for imperialism and militarism, but rather

sharpened it. The second great imperialist war, World War II, 
had been worse than the first.

Stalin and his subordinates saw, after the post–World War II 
consolidation, that there were five tasks they needed to carry out:
First, they had to build the USSR up militarily to defend the 
territories of really-existing socialism, because the fascist-milita-
rist capitalists might well try once again to destroy world social-
ism by military means. That was a reasonable notion, given that 
there were American generals—George Patton most prominent 
among them—who had wanted to start World War III the day 
after World War II ended, and ex-president Hoover thought that 
the United States had quite possibly fought on the wrong side in 
World War II. Although Hoover deeply regretted that the war 
had advanced the development of weapons of unbearable power, 
a president who thought like him might well use those weapons. 
From the Soviet point of view, more war in the not-so-distant 
future was a legitimate worry.

Second, Stalin and his followers thought, they had to extend 

the really-existing socialist order to new territories.

Third, the USSR had to advance economically, so as to realize 
the promise of socialism and demonstrate to the capitalist world 
how good life could be.

Fourth, they should stand ready to assist socialist movements 
in capitalist countries when they decided they were strong enough 
to attempt a revolution.

Fifth, they should lie low.
If  they  accomplished  those  tasks,  then,  they  thought—and 
their faith assured them—that the logic of imperialist-militarist 
capitalism would do the rest of the work. The capitalist powers 
would clash again, in another catastrophic world war. And, pro-
vided the really-existing socialist bloc could keep its head down 
and survive, in the aftermath it would expand again. That was the 
Soviet Union’s strategy: defend, rebuild, and wait, for history was 
on their side. Waging a cold war was not part of the plan.

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

Generals  like  Patton  and  ex-presidents  like  Hoover  aside, 
there was little appetite for confrontation in the West, either. Iso-
lationist currents in the United States were not as strong as they 
had been after World War I, but they were strong. Western Eu-
rope was exhausted. Rather than wishing to roll back really-exist-
ing socialism, Britain was seeking to find a role for its diminished 
(and diminishing) empire. General George Patton in the United 
States might muse about taking his Third Army’s tanks and driv-
ing to Moscow, but that was far beyond the pale for any sane pol-
itician (and most others) in the North Atlantic. After four years of 
bloodshed and sacrifice (for Americans, that is—it had been years 
longer for the populations of Europe and Asia), the prospect of 
sending millions more to die at the front was in bad odor.

The whiff of which was even detectable by Joseph Stalin. Sta-
lin did have a very strong taste for brutally snatching up territory 
when  he  thought  it  could  be  taken  cheaply—starting  with  the 
suppression of the Mensheviks in Georgia at the end of the Rus-
sian Civil War. But after World War II, he curbed his appetite. 
He did not impose a really-existing socialist government on Fin-
land, but let it remain democratic, as long as it was disarmed and 
joined to no potentially anti-Soviet alliances—and as long as its 
government was riddled with Soviet agents. He cut off support 
to the Communist Party of Greece—largely. He counseled Mao 
Zedong in China to join a coalition with Chiang Kai-shek and 
wait. Marx had promised and prophesied that the internal contra-
dictions of capitalism would destroy it. So there was no need for 
immediate action, and, indeed, action before the time was ripe 
might well be counterproductive.

Remember:  the  memory  of  the  Great  Depression  was  very 
fresh.  It  was  not  just  communists  who  thought  that  countries 
relying on the market were likely to lapse into a period of under-
employment  and  stagnation.  A  not  uncommon  judgment  was 
that history would dramatically reveal the superiority of central 
planning. The feeling, as Marxist economist Paul Sweezy wrote

in 1942, was that “the socialist sector of the world would [after 
World War II] quickly stabilize itself and push forward to higher 
standards of living, while the imperialist sector would flounder in 
difficulties.”6 Likewise, the British historian A. J. P. Taylor spoke 
in 1945 of how “nobody in Europe believes in the American way 
of life—that is, in private enterprise; or rather those who believe 
in it are a defeated party and a party which seems to have no 
more future.”7

But  Stalin  could  not  resist  grabbing  the  marshmallow.  In 
1948,  he  snatched  up  Czechoslovakia  in  a  coup  d’état.  More-
over, Mao Zedong ignored Josef Stalin’s cautions, defeated Chi-
ang Kai-shek, and chased him and his Kuomintang to Taiwan. 
No doubt Stalin heard whispers that he was being overly cau-
tious, perhaps that had lost his nerve as a result of the shocks 
of World War II. West of what was to become the Iron Cur-
tain, really- existing socialism was viewed with concern, disdain, 
and animus. Cadres had been decimated at the start of World 
War  II  by  the  departure  of  all  those  who  could  not  stomach 
the  Stalin-Hitler  Pact.  Really-existing  socialism  became  more 
unattractive the more outsiders were able to scrutinize it closely. 
Plus it ran into the buzzsaw of nationalism, again. Rather than 
any  universalizing  creed  binding  the  proletariat  regardless  of 
borders,  it  became  clearer  and  clearer  that  allegiance  to  real-
ly-existing socialism required submission to or absorption into 
the latest incarnation of Russian Empire. Waiting for the con-
tradictions of capitalism to emerge did not seem to be working, 
at least not quickly.

And so the post–World War II Soviet Union began to march 
toward  further  expansion  rather  than  consolidation.  And  the 
United States felt compelled to respond. The Truman adminis-
tration, which came into power in 1945 after Franklin Roosevelt’s 
death, believed—as many members of Congress did—that the US 
withdrawal from international engagement after World War I had

been one of the major triggers of World War II. Both the Truman 
administration and Congress wanted to make different mistakes, 
their own mistakes, rather than duplicate those of the past.

The view from Washington, DC, saw a Western Europe that 
might well run into the arms of really-existing socialism. In the 
aftermath of World War II, it was not clear that Western Eu-
rope would utilize market mechanisms to coordinate economic 
activity to any significant degree. Belief in the market had been 
severely shaken by the Great Depression. Wartime controls and 
plans, while implemented as extraordinary measures for extraor-
dinary  times,  had  created  a  governmental  habit  of  control  and 
regulation. Seduced by the very high economic growth rates re-
ported by Stalin’s Soviet Union, and awed by its war effort, many 
expected centrally planned economies to reconstruct faster and 
grow more rapidly than market economies.

Had  European  political  economy  taken  a  different  turn, 
post–World  War  II  European  recovery  might  have  been  stag-
nant. Governments might have been slow to dismantle wartime 
allocation controls, and so have severely constrained the market 
mechanism. Europe after World War II was in worse economic 
shape than it had been after World War I. Another episode of 
financial and political chaos like that which had plagued the con-
tinent following World War I appeared likely. Politicians were 
predisposed toward intervention and regulation: no matter how 
damaging “government failure” might be to the economy, it had 
to be better than the “market failure” of the Depression.

One can imagine an alternative scenario in which European 
governments maintained and expanded wartime controls in or-
der to guard against substantial shifts in income distribution. In 
such a case, the late 1940s and early 1950s might have seen the 
creation in Western Europe of allocative bureaucracies to ration 
scarce  foreign  exchange.  It  might  have  seen  the  imposition  of 
price controls on exports to keep some of home production in

the country, in order to protect the living standards of the ur-
ban working classes—as happened in various countries of Latin 
America, which nearly stagnated in the two decades after World 
War II. Consider Argentina, for example. In 1913, Buenos Aires 
was among the top twenty cities of the world in telephones per 
capita. In 1929 Argentina had been perhaps fourth in density of 
motor vehicles per capita, with approximately the same number 
of vehicles per person as France or Germany. Yet after World War 
II it rapidly fell from the ranks of the First World to the Third, 
with politics no more poisonous than Western European politics 
had typically been before World War II. From the perspective of 
1947, the political economy of Western Europe would lead one 
to think that it was at least as vulnerable as Argentina.8

Indeed, in 1946–1947, US State Department officials won-
dered whether Europe might be dying—like a wounded soldier 
who bleeds to death after the fighting. State Department memo-
randa presented an apocalyptic vision of a complete breakdown 
in Europe of the division of labor—between city and country, 
industry and agriculture, and different industries themselves. The 
war had given Europe more experience than Argentina with eco-
nomic  planning  and  rationing.  Militant  urban  working  classes 
calling  for  wealth  redistribution  voted  in  such  numbers  as  to 
make communists plausibly part of a permanent ruling political 
coalition  in  France  and  Italy.  Economic  nationalism  had  been 
nurtured by a decade and a half of Depression, autarky, and war. 
European political parties had been divided brutally along eco-
nomic class lines for two generations.

Certainly after World War I Western European growth had 
proceeded poorly—even more poorly than Argentinian growth 
after World War II. The recovery of coal production after World 
War I was erratic, and actually declined from 1920 to 1921, fall-
ing to 72 percent of 1913’s level. This drop was a result of the 
deflation imposed on the European economy by central banks, 
which sought the restoration of pre–World War I gold-standard

parities.  Coal  production  fell  again  in  1923–1924,  when  the 
French army occupied Germany’s Ruhr Valley, because repara-
tions were not being delivered fast enough. And coal production 
fell once more in 1925–1926, when austerity’s pressure to lower 
wages on Britain’s coal producers triggered first a coal and then a 
brief general strike.

Post–World War I Europe had seen the recovery of output re-
peatedly interrupted by political and economic “wars of attrition” 
between  different  classes  and  interests.  So  after  World  War  II, 
European political leaders were intently focused on the question 
of how these difficulties could be avoided and political compro-
mise attained. Indeed, if it had happened that such difficulties 
proved unavoidable, it seemed likely that Western Europe would 
vote to join Stalin’s empire.

Yet Europe avoided these traps. By 1949, national income per 
capita in Britain, France, and Germany had recovered to within a 
hair of prewar levels. By 1951, six years after the war, as the US-
led Marshall Plan to offer foreign aid to Europe came to an end, 
national  incomes  per  capita  were  more  than  10  percent  above 
prewar  levels.  Measured  by  the  admittedly  imperfect  yardstick 
of the national product estimates, the three major economies of 
Western  Europe  had  achieved  a  degree  of  recovery  that  post–
World War I Europe had not reached in the eleven years between 
World War I and the Great Depression.

Western Europe’s mixed economies built substantial systems 
for redistribution. But they built these systems on top of—and 
not  as  replacements  for—market  allocations  of  consumer  and 
producer  goods  and  the  factors  of  production.  Though  there 
was support for the restoration of a market economy in Western  
Europe, it was far from universal. Wartime controls were viewed 
as exceptional policies for exceptional times, but it was not clear 
what was to replace them. Communist and some socialist min-
isters opposed a return to the market. It was not clear when, or 
even if, the transition would take place. Yet it did.

Post–World War II Europe was very far indeed from laissez- 
faire. Government ownership of utilities and heavy industry was 
substantial.  Government  redistributions  of  income  were  large. 
The magnitude of the “safety nets” and social insurance programs 
provided by the post–World War II welfare states were far be-
yond anything that had been thought possible before World War 
I. But these large welfare states were accompanied by financial 
stability and by substantial reliance on market processes for allo-
cation and exchange.

Why did things go so well for Western Europe after World 

War II?

It  is  easy  to  conclude  that  Western  Europe’s  success  came 
thanks to the US administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
Harry S Truman. Hobbled inside the United States by a some-
times recalcitrant Congress, the US executive branch from 1945 
to 1952 somewhat strangely found itself with more power out-
side. First, it ran the occupations of Japan and the bulk of West 
Germany. It also extended a wide array of assistance—direct re-
lief, offers of military support against potential Soviet expansion, 
large-scale loans, and access to US markets—to Western Euro-
pean countries, and these programs shaped their post–World War 
II policies in ways that gave the US administration confidence.

Within two years of the end of the war, it became US pol-
icy  to  build  up  Western  Europe  politically,  economically,  and 
militarily.  The  Truman  Doctrine  inaugurated  the  policy  of 
“containment” of the Soviet Union. Included was a declaration 
that containment required steps to quickly regenerate economic 
prosperity in Western Europe. And as columnist Richard Strout 
wrote,  “one  way  of  combating  Communism  is  to  give  western 
Europe a full dinner pail.”9

Outflanking  isolationist  and  anti-spending  opposition,  the 
Truman administration maneuvered the Truman Doctrine, the 
Marshall Plan, and then the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

(NATO) for the defense of Europe through Congress. To do so, 
it employed every weapon at its disposal, including Secretary of 
State George C. Marshall’s reputation as the architect of military 
victory in World War II, conservative fears of the further exten-
sion  of  Stalin’s  empire,  and  a  political  alliance  with  influential 
Republican senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan.

Why was the plan named not for the US president, Truman, 
but for his secretary of state, Marshall? Truman put it best: “Can 
you imagine [the plan’s] chances of passage in an election year in 
a Republican [majority] congress if it is named for Truman and 
not Marshall?”10

The Marshall Plan was a large multiyear commitment. From 
1948  to  1951,  the  United  States  contributed  $13.2  billion  to 
European recovery. Of this total, $3.2 billion went to the United 
Kingdom, $2.7 billion to France, $1.5 billion to Italy, and $1.4 
billion to the Western-occupied zones of Germany that would 
become the post–World War II Bundesrepublik. Figure 1 percent 
of the US national income over the years the program ran. Fig-
ure 3 percent of Western European national income.

Marshall  Plan  dollars  did  affect  the  level  of  investment: 
countries that received large amounts of Marshall Plan aid in-
vested more. Barry Eichengreen and Marc Uzan calculated that 
out of each dollar of Marshall Plan aid some 65 cents went to 
increased  consumption  and  35  cents  to  increased  investment. 
The returns to new investment were high: an extra dollar of in-
vestment raised national product by 50 cents in the subsequent 
year. Another way that Marshall Plan aid stimulated growth was 
by  relaxing  foreign  exchange  constraints.  Marshall  Plan  funds 
were hard currency in a dollar-scarce world. After the war, coal, 
cotton, petroleum, and other materials were in short supply.11

But these direct effects were small potatoes. Marshall Plan aid 
plausibly boosted investment by only 1 percent of GDP. Even 
if it was concentrated on relieving the tightest bottleneck, such

a commitment over three years can hardly be thought to have 
boosted  Western  Europe’s  productive  potential  by  more  than  
1 percent. Yet Western Europe’s post–World War II growth ex-
ceeded  expectations  by  at  least  ten  times  that,  and  did  so  for 
three decades in a row.

It is most likely that the political-economic effects dominated, 
for after World War II the United States enthusiastically stepped 
into its role as the hegemon. Here the game theory matters: sim-
ply having an acknowledged hegemon made some things possi-
ble, made other things more possible, and amplified still other 
things that were accomplished because everyone understood how 
to coordinate and fell into line. Marshall Plan aid was precon-
ditioned on successful financial stabilization. Each recipient had 
to sign a bilateral pact with the United States. Countries had to 
agree to balance government budgets, restore internal financial 
stability, and stabilize exchange rates at realistic levels.

Financial  stabilization  required  balanced  budgets.  Balanced 
budgets  required  successful  resolution  of  distributional  con-
flicts. Here the Marshall Plan provided a very strong incentive. 
It gave European countries a pool of resources that could be used 
to cushion the wealth losses sustained in restructuring—and to 
soothe disappointed expectations from groups of labor and cap-
italists  and  landlords  who  thought  they  were  not  getting  their 
proper shares of the pie. Marshall Plan administrators with one 
hand  pressured  European  governments  and  interest  groups  to 
compromise, and to liberalize their economies in a more “Ameri-
can” mold. With the other hand they offered resources.

The resources did not obviate the need for sacrifice. But they 
increased the size of the pie available for division among interest 
groups.

And there were other institutions as well, besides the Marshall 
Plan’s European Recovery Administration pushing in a positive 
and positive-sum direction. In the mid-1950s Western Europe

created  its  own  European  Coal  and  Steel  Community  for  free 
trade in those commodities, an initiative that grew into today’s 
European Union. The dominant United States had bet heavily 
on international trade as an enabler of international peace as well 
as of domestic prosperity. At the 1944 Bretton Woods Confer-
ence, US Treasury Department official Harry Dexter White and 
John Maynard Keynes from Britain had designed a system to try 
to make increased globalization work for good. There was to be 
a World Bank—an International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development—to finance, via loans (on non-usurious terms), the 
reconstruction of those parts of the world that had been ruined 
by war and to develop those parts of the world that had not yet 
grasped the productive opportunities of modern machine and in-
dustrial technologies. There was also to be an International Mon-
etary  Fund  (IMF),  to  manage  the  values  of  currencies  and  the 
net flow of financial resources across borders, to help countries 
that  needed  to  reset  the  terms  on  which  they  traded  to  do  so, 
and to be the bad guy to urge, and perhaps command, countries 
that needed to live up to their obligations, and reorient how they 
managed their economies in order to do so. The fact that West-
ern Europe and the United States were together tied into alliance 
by the Cold War gave these institutions life and energy. Plus, the 
post–World War II global north was very lucky in its statesmen.
There was supposed to be an International Trade Organiza-
tion (ITO) as well, to negotiate mutually beneficial reductions 
in  tariffs  to  low  or  zero  levels,  and  to  referee  trading  disputes. 
But although the Truman administration had pushed the United 
Nations, the World Bank, and the IMF through Congress, it de-
cided at the end of 1950 that the ITO was too heavy a lift to 
even submit to Congress, given that by the end of that year the 
administration  needed  Congress  to  fund  the  Korean  War  and 
build  out  the  long-run  Cold  War  military  structure.  By  1950, 
too, open-handed international benevolent cooperation was out,

and  cash-on-the-barrelhead  demands  for  assistance  in  the  long 
twilight struggle between the free world and global communism 
were in. Instead of an organization with at least some teeth to 
enforce its judgments, there was to be an agreement—a General 
Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT)—under  the  aegis  of 
which multiple rounds of multilateral tariff reductions were to be 
gradually negotiated over decades.

And  so  a  sizable  part  of  the  credit  for  Europe’s  successful 
post–World War II reconstruction belongs to these acts of coop-
erative international statesmanship: the Marshall Plan and other 
initiatives  that  sped  Western  European  growth  by  altering  the 
environment in which political and economic policy was made. 
The Marshall Plan era saw the creation of the social democratic 
“mixed economy”: the restoration of price freedom and exchange 
rate stability, reliance on market forces within the context of a 
large  social  insurance  state,  some  public  ownership  of  industry 
and utilities, and a great deal of public demand management.

There was one additional very important factor making for 
post–World  War  II  social  democracy.  The  totalitarian  threat 
from Stalin’s Soviet Union across the Iron Curtain became very 
real. Many observers, such as the historian A. J. P. Taylor, simply 
did not believe “in the American way of life—that is, in private 
enterprise.” But on close inspection, really-existing socialism was 
something they could believe in even less. The higher standards of 
living in the really-existing socialist Eastern Bloc did not emerge. 
The Great Depression did not return to Western Europe. West-
ern Europeans came to fear a Soviet takeover. They wanted a US 
presence in Europe to deter such aggression. Hence they created 
the  North  Atlantic  alliance  and  were  willing  to  follow  Ameri-
ca’s lead, and to drag America into leadership if necessary. What 
America wanted, they were eager to provide.

There is a story that when the Belgian statesman Paul-Henri 
Spaak was asked if it wouldn’t be a good idea to set up a bunch 
of statues to the founders of the European Union, he answered:

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

“What a wonderful idea! We should erect a 50-foot tall statue in 
front of the Berlaymont [Palace in Brussels]! Of Joseph Stalin!”12 
It was the group of Soviet forces in Germany and the presence of 
the tanks of the Red Army at the Fulda Gap that most concen-
trated everyone’s mind on how much they wanted NATO, the 
Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Commu-
nity, and then the European Union to succeed.

BY 1948, THE US government had drawn up plans to wage a real 
cold war: plans for boosting defense spending to 10 percent of na-
tional income and deploying US armies all across the globe. But 
those plans remained fantasies for unimaginable contingencies— 
until the Korean War.

In 1950, the strongman Kim Il-Sung, whom Stalin had in-
stalled in North Korea at the end of World War II, begged him 
for tanks and support to take over the south. Split at the 38th 
parallel, a somewhat arbitrary line of latitude, Korea was divided 
between the Soviet-overseen north and the US-overseen south.

But when Kim Il-Sung put his request to Stalin, there were no 
US garrisons in the south. At the start of 1950, Dean Acheson—
now  secretary  of  state  for  President  Truman—announced  that 
the  day  of  “old  relationships  between  east  and  west  are  gone.” 
“At their worst,” he said, they had been “exploitation,” and “at 
their best . . . paternalism.” Now those relationships had come to 
an end, and the United States had a “defense perimeter” in the 
Pacific that ran from “the Aleutians to Japan and then . . . to the 
Ryukyus [south of Japan],” and finally to the Philippines. De-
fense outside that perimeter was for “the entire civilized world 
under the Charter of the United Nations.” For the United States 
to guarantee that it would come to the aid of any country outside 
of that area was “hardly sensible.” Moreover, even within the de-
fense perimeter in the Pacific, US strategists concluded, it made 
most sense to wield US power by air and sea rather than by land.13

Moreover, the United States was in favor of decolonization—
getting the British out of India, the Dutch out of Indonesia, and 
other global powers out of the territories they had held for years. 
While the United States was happy to provide logistical support 
to the French, who were fighting a war against the communist 
Vietminh in Southeast Asia, it wanted the French to promise in-
dependence rather than further colonial rule as the endpoint.

Acheson’s  speech,  however,  did  not  specifically  mention  
Korea or say how it fit into the defense perimeter in the Pacific. 
Did this omission tip the balance in Stalin’s mind? It may have. 
In June 1950, Stalin let slip the dog of war that was Kim Il-Sung 
and his Soviet-trained and supplied army. The Korean War be-
gan. The United States surprised Kim Il-Sung, Stalin, Mao, and 
itself by rallying the United Nations to send an army. That army 
was largely made up of US troops but formally was a force of the 
United Nations, and its mission was to defend the order that had 
been  established  in  the  US-controlled  zone  of  occupation  that 
was to become South Korea—and perhaps to create a single uni-
fied Korea as well.

Fighting raged all across the Korean Peninsula, from near the 
Yalu River in the north to the Port of Pusan in the south. South 
Koreans and North Koreans fought on land; Americans fought 
on land, in the sea, and in the air; Chinese fought on land; Rus-
sians  fought  in  the  air  (350  of  its  planes  were  shot  down).  In 
three years, somewhere between 1 million and 2 million Korean 
civilians  died,  5  to  10  percent  of  the  population,  and  perhaps 
400,000  South  Koreans  were  abducted  from  their  homes  and 
taken to North Korea. The military dead and missing amounted 
to roughly 500,000 Chinese, 300,000 North Koreans, 150,000 
South Koreans, 50,000 Americans, and 4,400 others who fought 
to defend South Korea. The US Air Force dropped half a million 
tons of bombs during the war, which works out to 40 pounds for 
every North Korean then alive.

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

The  United  States  did  not  use  its  nuclear  weapons.  It  was 
a war, but it was a limited war. US theater of operations com-
mander General Douglas MacArthur asked for their use at the 
end of 1950, when the Chinese People’s Liberation Army forced 
the  United  Nations’  army  to  retreat  from  near  the  Yalu  River 
back to south of Seoul. The Pentagon and President Harry Tru-
man refused.

Nonnuclear  arms  proved  sufficient,  and  starting  in  March 
1951, the battlefront stabilized near the 38th parallel, the original 
divide between north and south. The Pentagon and Truman be-
gan to seek a ceasefire and a return to the status quo ante—leaving 
neither victor nor vanquished.

On March 5, 1953, as the war dragged on, Joseph Stalin died 
of a stroke. Stalin’s heirs decided that the Korean War was point-
less and should end. Mao’s negotiators accepted the United Na-
tions’ prisoner-of-war position: repatriation would not be forced. 
As  a  consequence,  10,000  of  15,000  Chinese  prisoners  of  war 
decided not to return to China; 5,000 of 70,000 North Korean 
prisoners of war decided not to return to North Korea; and 327 
South Korean prisoners of war decided to stay in North Korea, 
as did 21 Americans and 1 Briton. (Eventually, 18 of these 22 
returned to the Western Bloc.)14

And so began the state of affairs that would continue for de-
cades,  even  past  the  end  of  the  long  twentieth  century—with 
North Korea still under the autocratic rule of the Kim dynasty, 
which presided over one of the worst famines of the post–World 
War II period, and with South Korea independent—a rich indus-
trial power and a democracy.

But the Korean War was important not just for Korea. The 
Korean War was one of those butterfly-wing flaps that changed 
the  world,  for  it  turned  the  United  States  and  its  national  se-
curity apparatus onto a new path, one defined by spending five 
times  the  previous  level  of  annual  military  expenditure  and  by

establishing a truly global reach. Put succinctly, in the aftermath 
of the Korean War the United States took up a new role.

To start with, Germany looked analogous to Korea—a coun-
try divided by what had been intended to be a temporary, post-
war military occupation boundary.

Stalin’s  successors  were  largely  unknown.  The  only  certain 
thing  about  them  was  that  they  had  flourished—which  often 
meant managed to survive—under Stalin, and that they proved 
willing to shoot a couple of their own number in the struggle that 
followed Stalin’s death.

Thus, by the middle of the 1950s, there was a full US army 
sitting in West Germany waiting for Stalin’s successors to attempt 
in Germany what Stalin, Mao, and Kim Il-Sung had attempted 
in Korea: the reunification by force of a country that had been 
divided by the armistice that ended World War II.

What  had  before  June  1950  been  the  fantasies  of  national 
security  staffers  and  planners  became  reality:  they  were  able  to 
push US national security spending up to 10 percent of national 
income. The weapons were, by and large, not used. But the fact 
that the government was buying them made a return of anything 
like the Great Depression all but impossible. It provided a strong 
floor to demand and employment in the United States—for the 
government  bought,  and  those  it  bought  from  put  people  to 
work, and had the revenue to buy other things, and so to put still 
other people to work.

This spending was in large part intended as a way of allowing 
the United States to project its Cold War military might far beyond 
its borders. The United States deployed troops and established per-
manent military bases on every continent save Antarctica. Roughly 
three-quarters of a percent of the US national product in the mid-
1950s was “net military transactions”—expenditures abroad by the 
US  military  that  generated  no  dollar  inflow.  In  Europe,  the  in-
crease in net US military transactions did much to offset the wind-
ing-down of the Marshall Plan. In short, NATO provided more

than shock troops to thwart a Soviet invasion. It also provided one 
more  secure  source  of  demand  for  European  production  during 
Europe’s booms in the 1950s and 1960s.

Which brings us to nuclear weaponry.
From 1956, the formal policy of the Soviet Union was “peaceful 
coexistence.” The Russians would, of course, continue to support 
just revolts against colonialism and capitalism. But war between 
the superpowers? Off the table. The United States and the USSR 
would coexist. The priority would be to lie low and demonstrate 
really-existing  socialism’s  advantages—which  would  lead  to  tri-
umph in the end, of course.

From 1954, the US policy became one of “massive retalia-
tion.” In a speech that year, Secretary of State Allen Dulles made 
clear that the strategy would be to “contain the mighty landpower 
of the Communist world”: “The way to deter aggression,” he said, 
was for “the free community to be willing and able to respond 
vigorously at places and with means of its own choosing.”15 This 
policy, pointedly, did not take a nuclear-weapon response to a 
conventional provocation off the table; nor did it restrict retalia-
tion and deterrence to the particular theater of conflict.

Each side viewed the other as a potential existential threat, 

which led to both sides becoming existential threats in fact.

Nuclear forces that US planners regarded as perhaps inade-
quate to deter a Russian nuclear strike or conventional-force in-
vasion of Western Europe struck Russian planners as dangerously 
close  to  a  level  of  force  that  could  devastate  the  Soviet  Union 
and support a conventional occupation of their territory. They 
remembered the burning of Moscow by the Crimean Tartars in 
1571, the occupation of Moscow by the Poles in 1610, the in-
vasion by the Swedes in 1709, the occupation of Moscow by the 
French in 1812, the German-dictated Peace of Brest-Litovsk in 
1918, and Hitler’s invasion in 1941.

But the key word in Dulles’s 1954 speech detailing America’s 
strategy of massive resistance was “contain”: the US policy, and

indeed the NATO alliance’s policy, for the Cold War was one 
of containment. As US diplomat George Kennan put it, the right 
strategy was one of “holding the line and hoping for the best.” 
Because “ideology convinces the rulers of Russia that truth is on 
their  side  and  they  can  therefore  afford  to  wait,”  he  went  on, 
“Soviet pressure” could be “contained by the adroit and vigilant 
application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geo-
graphical and political points.”

And there was more: “The issue of Soviet-American relations 
is in essence a test of the overall worth of the United States as a 
nation among nations,” Kennan wrote:

The thoughtful observer of Russian-American relations will 
find  no  cause  for  complaint  in  the  Kremlin’s  challenge  to 
American  society.  He  will  rather  experience  a  certain  grat-
itude  to  a  Providence  which,  by  providing  the  American 
people with this implacable challenge, has made their entire 
security  as  a  nation  dependent  on  their  pulling  themselves 
together and accepting the responsibilities of moral and po-
litical leadership that history plainly intended them to bear.16

It  was  American  Exceptionalism  with  a  capital  “E”  taken 
to the max. If only the United States could, Kennan believed, 
truly be a City Upon a Hill—if only it could, as John Winthrop 
had preached back in 1630, “follow the counsel of Micah, to 
do  justly,  to  love  mercy,  to  walk  humbly  with  our  God,”  so 
that “he shall make us a praise and glory that men shall say of 
succeeding plantations, ‘may the Lord make it like that of New- 
England’”—if  only  it  could  behave  thusly,  then  the  United 
States and the NATO alliance would have nothing to fear from 
the Cold War.

The Americans who ran foreign policy overwhelmingly agreed. 
Nevertheless, the menace of totalitarianism loomed large. It was true 
that one, the greater, totalitarian power had been scotched—Nazi

Germany. But another, if lesser, version—Stalin’s and Mao’s sys-
tems of really-existing socialism—was growing. The nations that 
it comprised were materially weak, and poor. But they were popu-
lous. And their governments had a disturbing ability to get people 
to endorse and fight for their cause by telling implausible lies.

For  the  majority  of  the  United  States’  political  leaders  and 
their military and diplomatic staffs, however, there was no rea-
son to panic. Deterrence would control the nuclear threat. The 
Kremlin was run by colorless apparatchiks who liked their stan-
dard of living and position. Bureaucratic ossification was the des-
tiny of really-existing socialism, if only it could be contained and 
outwaited. They were right to think so.

Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev also saw no reason to panic, 
and every reason to wait for the verdict of history. “Whether you 
like it or not, history is on our side,” he said in 1956.17 More 
ominously, he added, “We will bury you.” But this translation 
could use further explanation. Probably the Russian, “Mы вас 
похороним,” meant something like “We will outlast you.” Later 
on, Khrushchev clarified what he had meant: “I once said, ‘We 
will bury you,’ and I got into trouble with it. Of course, we will 
not bury you with a shovel. Your own working class will bury 
you.”  Russia  had  lost  27  million  people  in  World  War  II— 
including those who starved to death. Nobody in Russia wanted 
World War III.

And so the world entered a stable, well-shy-of-utopia equilib-

rium, though you had to squint hard to see it.

There were reasons for Khrushchev to have confidence, rea-
sons derivable not from the excellences of really-existing social-
ism’s central-planning mechanisms, but from the deficiencies of 
market  economies.  After  all,  market  economies  can  and  do  go 
horribly wrong. Markets carry out their implicitly assigned tasks 
with ruthless efﬁciency. The key to managing systems of markets 
is to determine what instructions the market is being implicitly 
given,  and  how  to  alter  those  instructions.  A  market  economy

can  only  produce  good  results  if  it  defines  the  general  welfare 
appropriately—if it weights the material well-being and utility of 
each individual in an appropriate manner as it adds up and makes 
tradeoffs. And the problem is that the value that a market econ-
omy gives an individual depends on his or her wealth.

Suppose  each  doubling  of  material  consumption  adds  an 
equal  amount  to  individual  utility—that  the  ﬁrst  dollar  of  in-
come is more valuable than the second, the second more valuable 
than the third, and so on. Then theoretical economists’ formu-
las and theorems take on a particularly simple form: the market 
maximizes the general welfare if and only if the general welfare 
weights each person’s well-being by the market value of his or 
her wealth. With unequal distribution, a market economy will 
generate extraordinarily cruel outcomes. If my wealth consists en-
tirely of my ability to work with my hands in someone else’s ﬁeld, 
and if the rains do not come, so that my ability to work with my 
hands has no productive market value, then the market will starve 
me to death—as it did to millions of people in Bengal in 1942 
and 1943.

The market could fail.
And  central  planning  could  succeed.  The  Soviet  economy 
had,  after  all,  proven  itself  very  effective  in  building  the  most 
cost-effective tanks of World War II, the T34C and the T34/85. 
American tank production was more efficient. But the centrally 
planned economy mobilized more resources. And as long as there 
is  just  one,  or  a  few,  overwhelming  goals  to  be  accomplished, 
inefficiencies  from  overenthusiastic  and  overrigid  plans  are  of  
second-order importance.

A centrally planned economy has an easier time persuading 
those  who  would  otherwise  divert  resources  from  investment 
to consumption not to do so. US economists in the 1950s and 
1960s speculated about a future in which the USSR’s higher share 
of national income devoted to investment would give it, in the 
long run, a much greater capital intensity. The added production

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

from that capital intensity might then outweigh the efficiencies of 
central planning and provide Soviet citizens with a high material 
standard of living in spite of planned inefficiency.

And there was never any terribly good reason to believe that 
market economies were by any theoretical necessity superior in 
the discovery, development, and deployment of technology. The 
Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik, the first satellite, was an es-
pecially loud wake-up call to any who did not see Kennan’s call 
to fight the Cold War by making America into its best self as a 
serious challenge requiring serious effort.

WAS THIS NON-UTOPIA STABLE? The post–World War II world 
stood  under  the  shadow  of  nuclear  war.  The  nuclear  weapons 
strategists embraced “MAD” strategies, which seemed to be not 
just an acronym for “mutual assured destruction” but also accu-
rate shorthand for “insane.”

And  the  world  was  not  free  from  other  serpents  in  the 
garden— other forms of militarism and imperialism, of national, 
cultural, and economic rivalries.

For example, in the same letter in which Truman’s successor, 
President Dwight Eisenhower, admonished his brother Edgar for 
imagining that his administration could, or should, roll back the 
New  Deal,  he  boasted  about  how  the  CIA  under  his  adminis-
tration had led the coup that had entrenched Mohammed Reza 
Pahlavi  as  shah  and  dictator  in  Iran,  thus  keeping  the  oil-rich 
states of the Middle East from going commie. Eisenhower was 
certain that the Truman administration would have allowed just 
that—and  so  he  believed  he  had  largely  removed  the  greatest 
“threat that has in recent years overhung the free world.”18 But 
no rational person saw the Iranian prime minister, Mohammad 
Mosaddegh, as a little Stalin, or even a Lenin.

Two decades later, rational believers in peaceful coexistence 
would  have  watched  the  elected  Chilean  president,  Salvador

Allende,  with  interest,  though  perhaps  not  enthusiasm.  If  his 
attempts  to  manage  a  peaceful  transition  to  a  more  attractive 
form of really-existing socialism failed to produce prosperity and 
liberty, it would be a useful warning to other nations, as some-
thing it would be better not to do. If Allende succeeded, it might 
be a model that other countries could draw on to make them-
selves better. But that was not the logic of Cold Warriors: they 
sought  the  military  coup  by  general-turned-dictator  Augusto  
Pinochet, along with mass executions, and right-wing ideologues 
proclaimed the necessity of Pinochet taking on a role analogous 
to  that  of  the  mythical  classical  Greek  lawmaker  Lykourgos  of 
Sparta.  On  the  other  side  of  the  Iron  Curtain,  rational  believ-
ers in peaceful coexistence would have welcomed the attempts of 
Czechoslovakia’s  Alexander  Dubček  to  build  “socialism  with  a 
human face,” but instead, the reaction of Leonid Brezhnev in the 
Kremlin was to send in the tanks: really-existing socialism did not 
and could not be allowed to have a human face.

And  yet,  for  some  other  colonized  nations  during  the  first 
post–World War II generation, the Cold War might be a bless-
ing. Before independence, they could push for decolonization by 
arguing that if it was delayed, the Russians and the Chinese would 
use the grievances justly felt by the colonized to build support 
for insurgencies, which would risk that nation joining the com-
munist bloc. After independence, they could declare themselves 
“nonaligned,” taking their cue from the movement that started 
at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, spearheaded by Indo-
nesian strongman Sukarno and Indian prime minister Jawaharlal 
Nehru. Nonaligned nations could then call for bids of support 
from both sides in the Cold War. The more important the non-
aligned state was to the Cold War’s dueling contestants, the more 
both  sides  would  be  willing  to  spend  to  support  a  nonaligned 
government that was trying to decide what its political and eco-
nomic system, or at least its allegiances, should be.

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

Of course, the hotter the Cold War became, the more likely 
it was that a government or a popular movement trying to steer 
its own course would be pulled up short by the choke-chain of 
one of the superpowers, and that people would die. Yugoslavia 
and Finland managed to pursue their own paths—but the Red 
Army stepped in to enforce the party line and discipline in East 
Germany  in  1953,  in  Hungary  in  1956,  in  Czechoslovakia  in 
1968, and in Afghanistan in 1978. The United States sponsored 
coups or sent troops to overthrow governments in Iran and Gua-
temala in 1954, Cuba in 1961, Chile in 1973, the Dominican 
Republic  and  Nicaragua  in  1981,  and  Grenada  in  1983.  And 
there were the cases where the Cold War turned genuinely hot: 
Korea  (5  million  dead),  Vietnam  (2.5  million  dead),  Ethiopia 
(1.5 million dead), Angola (500,000 dead), and more.

There were governments as well that attacked their own so-
cieties: somewhere between 100,000 and 500,000 of Indonesia’s 
population  of  100  million  were  murdered  in  1965,  “the  year 
of  living  dangerously.”  Strongman  Indonesian  leader  Suharto 
used an attempted communist coup as a pretext to sideline the 
previous  strongman  leader,  Sukarno,  and  then  slaughter  every  
Indonesian  whom  anyone  said  might  be  a  communist.  The 
Khmer Rouge in 1975–1979 killed perhaps 2 million of Cambo-
dia’s 8 million people for no reason whatsoever—and still China 
and  the  United  States  backed  the  Khmer  Rouge  against  the 
Cambodian government that the Vietnamese installed in 1979. 
There were more—many more—such instances.

As  bad  as  these  large-scale  butcheries  were,  there  was  al-
ways the potential for even more disastrous outcomes, and every 
now  and  then,  the  stability  of  this  non-utopia  teetered  toward 
Armageddon.

For  example,  humanity  perched  on  the  edge  of  thermonu-
clear war during the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. Nikita 
Khrushchev was somewhat surprised by the bellicose reaction of

US president John F. Kennedy to Russia’s deployment in Cuba 
of missiles like those the United States had previously deployed 
in Turkey, next to Russia’s border. In the end, the United States 
promised not to overthrow the Cuban communist dictator, Fi-
del Castro, by force, and Russia withdrew its missiles from Cuba. 
More quietly, the United States withdrew its missiles from Turkey.
It has gone down in American political historical lore that, 
eyeball to eyeball, Russia blinked. Perhaps. But it should also be 
noted that Russia was the reasonable one, willing to lose “face,” 
for both sides agreed to keep the US withdrawal from Turkey a 
secret. A lot of grossly misleading histories were written over the 
next two decades based on those bad-faith reports—some by Ken-
nedy administration insiders—before that secret was revealed.

There were other teeters.
In 1960, the moonrise was mistaken by NATO radar for a 
nuclear attack—and the United States went on high alert, even 
though Khrushchev was in New York City at the United Nations 
at  the  time.  In  1967,  the  North  American  Aerospace  Defense 
Command (NORAD) thought a solar flare was Soviet radar jam-
ming, and nearly launched its bombers. In 1979, the loading of a 
training scenario onto an operational computer led NORAD to 
call the White House, claiming that the USSR had launched 250 
missiles against the United States, and that the president had only 
between three and seven minutes to decide whether to retaliate. 
In 1983, the Soviet Union’s Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov 
refused to classify an early warning system missile sighting as an 
attack, dismissing it (correctly) as an error, and thereby prevent-
ing a worse error.

That same year, the Soviet Air Force mistook an off-course 
Korean airliner carrying 100 people for one of the United States’ 
RC-135 spy planes that routinely violated Russian air space, and 
shot it down. In 1988, the US Navy cruiser Vincennes—at the 
time in Iranian territorial waters without Iran’s permission—shot 
down an Iranian airliner carrying 290 people.

The Cold War of Hostile Yet Coexisting Systems 

Sometimes, the Cold War went badly. Sometimes very badly. 

And sometimes it threatened to go very, very badly indeed.

It is salutary to admit that the Cold War could have ended 
otherwise. It could have ended horribly. It could have ended with 
an Eastern Bloc victory, or a more permanent stasis that might 
still be going on. Why didn’t it? People could and did make a 
difference. Those who made the greatest difference, I think, were 
those who kept the Cold War from getting hot, those who per-
suaded many who wanted to keep fighting it that it was over, and 
those who worked hardest to make the social democratic Western 
alliance its best self.

There was, after all, a deadly serious underlying contest. Two 
systems were purporting to have their people’s interests, perhaps 
even  their  best  interests,  in  mind.  And  in  1990  it  was  unam-
biguously the case that one of those two was better, or perhaps 
just less bad. But be not proud: in many ways, it is less the case 
that  the  “West”  categorically  proved  its  system  to  be  the  best 
than that it categorically proved its system not to be worse. Not 
more utopian, so much as less dystopian. For by that time, the 
Soviet Union had set a rather low bar by which to judge better  
and worse.

False (and True) Starts  

to Economic Development  

in the Global South

F or many, many pages now the focus has been on the global 

north. That is fair. It, for the most part, led the world in the 
causal dance of economic history. And the struggle over systems 
was—China a very important aside—carried out in and near the 
global north. But now it is time to survey what was happening in 
the meantime in the poorer and less industrialized and deindus-
trialized parts of the world, addressing the era between the fall of 
China’s Qing dynasty in 1911 and the end of the Cold War in 
1990.

As economist W. Arthur Lewis warned in 1978, the history of 
the global south is so varied that you can find in it at least one ex-
ample of any interpretive position you might wish to assert.1 For 
my purposes, this means acknowledging that it is where grand 
narratives risk running aground, again and again and again. Still, 
I hold to their virtue—that is, to the ability of grand narratives to 
help us think—and it is in that spirit that I undertake this grand 
narrative. The five themes—economic history, the technological 
cornucopia,  government  mismanagement,  world  globalization,

and  intensive  tyranny—remain  the  same  in  my  analysis  of  the 
global south as they were for the global north. And it is with these 
in mind that I freely admit, with scholarly wincing, that my plan 
for this chapter is to briefly give an overview and then zoom in to 
particular vignettes.

In 1870, when the long twentieth century began, British in-
dustry stood at the leading edge of economic and technological 
progress, and the world’s real income per capita had reached per-
haps  $6,000  a  year.  However,  that  was  already  at  least  double 
what was found anywhere outside the charmed area of Britain (in 
the circle centered on Dover), its overseas settler colonies, and the 
United States, its ex-colony. Outside this nascent global north, 
our standard estimates show annual income per capita levels with 
a spread of a factor of five, ranging from $600 in the poorer parts 
of Africa to $3,000 in those European economies about to join 
the global north. The curve is heavily weighted toward the lower 
end, because China and India were then in the down-phase of 
the Malthusian cycle. The average per capita annual income level 
within the global south alone was perhaps $1,300.

By 1911 the world had grown—largely together. Global-south 
incomes were now spread by a factor of almost six, ranging from 
$700 to $4,000—with Russia, fueled by French loan capital to 
build its railways, in the lead. The global-south center of gravity 
had inched up to perhaps $1,500. That’s not bad growth mea-
sured against previous eras. But the technological frontier of the 
global north was growing at a much faster pace.

Then, over the years when the global north writhed—world 
war, Great Depression, world war, Cold War—the global south 
diverged even more substantially, falling further behind. As the 
end of the Cold War neared in 1990, the United States (which 
by  that  time  had  replaced  Britain  as  the  leading  edge  of  tech-
nological and economic progress) reached an average per capita 
income level of $35,000. That was still twice the high end of the 
average income range in the global south, which now stretched

from $600 to $17,000, a factor of about twenty-eight. And the 
center  of  gravity  of  the  global  south  was  at  perhaps  $2,500, 
largely  because  China  and  India  were  still  desperately  poor. 
Many global-south economies had managed to take some advan-
tage of technologies from the global north in their domestic pro-
duction. Others had benefited substantially from enhanced and 
richer markets for their exports. But the results were strikingly 
at variance with the expectations of neoclassical, neoliberal, and 
neoliberal- adjacent  economists  like  myself,  who  hold  that  dis-
covery is—or should be—more difficult than development, that 
development is more difficult than deployment, and so that the 
world economy should “converge” over time. Between 1911 and 
1990 that did not happen. The opposite did: the world economy 
diverged to a stunning degree.2

How to make sense of this? Economic historian Robert Allen 
had a checklist that countries needed to work through in order to 
step onto the escalator to prosperity that was post-1870 economic 
growth. It included having a stable, market-promoting govern-
ment; building railroads, canals, and ports; chartering banks for 
commerce and investment; establishing systems of mass educa-
tion; and imposing tariffs to protect industries and the commu-
nities of engineering practice that support them, and in which 
their  long-run  comparative  advantage  lay.  Then,  in  addition, 
there needed to be a “Big Push” to set all the virtuous circles of 
economic development in motion.3

For most of the economies in the global south, it simply did 
not happen. They did not catch up to, or even keep pace with, 
the fast-runners of economic growth and development. The rea-
son? The pre–World War II colonial masters did next to nothing 
to prepare the colonized nations of Asia and Africa for indepen-
dent prosperity. Before World War II, these colonizers had little 
interest in bringing about a Big Push to jumpstart the economies 
and aid the populations of their colonial subjects. Compound-
ing their problems, the workers of the colonized nations of Asia

and Africa faced stiff competition from the workers of extremely  
low-wage India and China, which hindered their ability to build 
the  sort  of  middle  class  that  could  have  driven  demand  and 
spurred industry.

Similar patterns held elsewhere in the global south. Consider 
Latin  America,  which  had  achieved  independence  from  Spain 
and Portugal early in the 1800s. Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, 
and the others suffered, by and large, from what one might call 
“internal colonialists”: a landed elite privileged by property own-
ership  and  Iberian  descent  that  feared  an  educated  proletariat, 
loved foreign-made manufactures, and had Iberian-derived legal 
systems that did not mesh well with the needs of commerce and 
industry.4

After World War II, the now dominant United States would 
not  bless  the  aging  colonial  empires.  The  “winds  of  change” 
would bring independence to Asia and Africa.5 And in one of the 
more bitter ironies of colonization, the false claim of a civilizing 
mission that had justified empires was dropped right when acting 
on it in fact would have made a difference. After generations of 
providing  to  the  colonizers,  the  ex-colonized  needed  help.  Yet 
back in the colonial masters’ home offices there was little appetite 
for meeting the needs of reconstruction and financing. Instead, 
Britain, France, and the others withdrew bit by bit.

Newly decolonized nations tried to follow the plan the wise 
men of the global north had laid out for them. Many of them 
began  with  bureaucracies  and  structures  of  government  typical 
of the industrial north: representative parliamentary institutions, 
independent judiciaries, laws establishing freedom of speech and 
of assembly, and a formally apolitical civil service bureaucracy. 
The goal was to achieve typical liberal democratic politics. Power 
would alternate among parties somewhat to the left and some-
what to the right of some sober median voter center. And, it was 
presumed, economic prosperity would follow.

But it was not to be. These ex-colonized nations could build 
the  railroads,  canals,  and  ports.  They  could  charter  the  banks 
for commerce and investment. They could establish educational 
systems and impose tariffs to nurture modern industries and the 
communities  of  engineering  practice  in  which  their  long-run 
comparative advantage lay. But taking these steps did not auto-
matically put them onto the escalator to prosperity. Something 
else, the Big Push, was necessary.

In much of the global south, the political aftermath of de-
colonization turned out to be a long-run disappointment. The 
hoped-for  liberal  democratic  politics  became  rare  exceptions 
rather than the norm. This was a problem for economic devel-
opment, because so much of the checklist of prosperity was pred-
icated on Westminster-style parliamentary politics, independent 
judiciaries,  and  the  like—but  these  took  root  rarely  and  shal-
lowly. The important exception was India.6 Elsewhere, regimes 
emerged that derived their authority not from electoral competi-
tion among different groups, but from the army and the police, 
whose authority came from suppressing dissent with varying lev-
els of brutality, or—in the best case—from populist attachment 
to a charismatic nation-symbolizing reforming leader. Through-
out much of the newly decolonized third world, political democ-
racy collapsed with disheartening speed. One of the first political 
leaders to fall victim was the elected Nigerian prime minister, 
Abubakar Tafawa Balewa.

The disheartened had been, quite likely, delusional in their 
optimism. There was no historical reason to suppose that repre-
sentative democracy and liberal freedom would be durable in the 
global south, or, for that matter, in the global north. Indeed, there 
was recent history to suggest the opposite was true. The country 
of Goethe and Schiller could not maintain them, after all. The 
“mother of parliaments” in Britain’s Palace of Westminster took 
centuries to grow its procedures, gain its powers, and work its way

toward a workable approximation of representative democracy. 
And the democratizing phase of the great French Revolution had 
lasted for less than four years. Why should anyone expect it to be 
different elsewhere?

Still, even if the recently decolonized countries were unsuc-
cessful  in  implementing  political  democracy  and  freedom,  it 
seemed inevitable that they would reap some economic benefits. 
After all, the storehouse of industrial technologies that had been 
developed since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution was 
open to all. The forms of knowledge and technologies that made 
the  global  north  so  rich  were  public  goods.  The  beneﬁts  from 
tapping  this  storehouse  were  enormous,  and  had  the  potential 
to multiply the wealth of all social groups and classes—property 
owners and non-property owners, politically powerful and politi-
cally powerless alike—manyfold. It stands to reason that all devel-
oping economies ought to have experienced not just substantial 
growth  in  absolute  living  standards  and  productivity  levels  in 
the years following their independence, but ought to have closed 
some of the prosperity gap vis-à-vis the world’s industrial leaders.
The global south did grow, by and large. But it did not catch 
up. Latin America lost a decade of development in the 1980s. As 
of the early 2020s, Chile and Panama are the only Latin Ameri-
can countries that are better off than China, while Mexico, Costa 
Rica,  and  Brazil  are  China’s  rough  equals.  In  Africa,  only  Bo-
tswana. In Asia, only Japan, the Four Tigers (South Korea, Tai-
wan, Hong Kong, and Singapore), Malaysia, and Thailand. The 
gap between China and the global north is still a factor of about 
3.5 to 1. It was not all disappointing: progress in education and 
health was rapid and extremely heartening. But that did not hide 
the disappointing growth in material production.

And Africa has fallen way, way behind: South Africa, Kenya, 
Zambia, Ghana, and Nigeria—all those for which in the 1960s 
there were great expectations for economic development—have 
fallen well short of their promise. Perhaps most discouraging,

during  the  generation  after  independence,  was  the  fall  in  the 
production and export of crops that had been the staples of Af-
rican exports. As scholar Robert Bates wrote as early as the start 
of the 1980s, “Palm oil in Nigeria, groundnuts in Senegal, cot-
ton in Uganda, and cocoa in Ghana were once among the most 
prosperous industries in Africa. But in recent years, farmers of 
these crops have produced less, exported less, and earned less.” 
The only continent in which farmers still made up a plurality 
of the workforce was spending an ever-increasing portion of its 
export earnings on imported food.7

In 1950, more than half the world’s population still lived in 
extreme poverty: at the living standard of our typical pre-indus-
trial  ancestors.  By  1990  it  was  down  to  a  quarter.  By  2010  it 
would  be  less  than  12  percent.  And  in  1950,  most  of  this  ex-
treme  poverty  was  spread  throughout  the  global  south.  There-
after it would become concentrated in Africa, where, by 2010, 
some three-fifths of the world’s extreme poor would reside. This 
concentration came as a surprise: there had been few signs back 
in  the  late  colonial  days  of  palm  oil,  groundnuts,  cotton,  and 
cocoa exports—the days when Zambia was more industrialized 
than, and almost as rich as, Portugal—that Africa south of the 
Sahara  would  fall  further  and  further  behind,  and  not  just  be-
hind the global north, but behind the rest of the global south as 
well. From 1950 to 2000, Egypt and the other countries of North 
Africa grew along with the world at about 2 percent per year in 
average incomes. But—to pick three countries from south of the 
Sahara—Ethiopia, Ghana, and Zambia grew at only 0.3 percent 
per year.

Thinkers  like  Nathan  Nunn  grappled  with  this  data  and 
concluded  that  this  retardation  had  something  to  do  with  the 
massive slave trades that had afflicted Africa in previous years.8 
There had been other massive slave trades: the armies and elite 
citizens of classical Greek and Rome had stolen 30 million peo-
ple over the span of a millennium and moved them around the

Mediterranean. The Vikings had stolen perhaps 1 million—mov-
ing slaves from Russia to western Europe or down to the Aegean, 
and  moving  Irish  and  Britons  to  Russia.  Over  the  millennium 
before 1800, perhaps 1.5 million Europeans were kidnapped and 
taken as slaves to North Africa. Between 1400 and 1800, some  
3 million people were enslaved in what is now southern Russia 
and Ukraine and sold south of the Black Sea.

But the African slave trades were bigger, by most estimates: 
13 million were carried across the Atlantic over the period from 
1600 to 1850; 5 million were carried across the Indian Ocean 
between 1000 and 1900; 3 million were carried north across the 
Sahara from 1200 to 1900, and an unknown number were taken 
in  internal  African  slave  trades—which  did  not  stop  when  the 
transoceanic trades did: even if Europeans and Middle Easterners 
would no longer buy slaves, the slaves could be put to work on 
plantations producing crops that they would buy. Compare these 
numbers to a population in Africa in 1700 of perhaps 60 million, 
and to perhaps 360 million people born in Africa and surviving 
to age five over the years from 1500 to 1800.

Being  subjected  to  millennium-spanning  slave  raiding  as  a 
major  part  of  life  created  a  long-lasting  durable  culture  of  so-
cial distrust. In a well-functioning market economy you begin 
nearly every meeting you have with a stranger thinking that this 
person  might  become  a  counterpart  in  some  form  of  win-win 
economic, social, or cultural exchange. This is not the case if you 
think there is even a small chance that the stranger is in fact a 
scout for people with weapons over the next hill who will seek to 
enslave you, and perhaps kill you or your family in the process. 
This background assumption of distrust did not matter much as 
long as the trading and commercial infrastructure of the colo-
nizers governed economic activity. But after the colonizers left, 
the distrust came to the forefront, and it led people to grab for 
weapons more quickly and more often than they would have in 
a more trusting society.

Remember  assassinated  Nigerian  prime  minister  Abubakar 
Tafawa  Balewa?  He  had  been  born  in  the  north  of  the  British 
colony of Nigeria in 1912 and had been sent to boarding school 
at  Katsina  College.  There,  he  was  student  number  145,  to  be 
slotted into the imperial bureaucracy as a teacher of English. He 
did very well. By 1941 he was a headmaster. In 1944 he was sent 
to University College London, to be trained to become a schools 
inspector for the colonial administration.

But earlier, back when he was twenty-two, in 1934, a colonial 
official  named  Rupert  East  had  commissioned  five  novellas,  to 
be written in Hausa, in an attempt to spread literacy. East had 
wanted to build up an “indigenous literature” that was more or 
less secular—that would not be “purely religious or written with 
a strong religious motive.” Abubakar Tafawa Balewa contributed, 
and he chose to write about slavery.

In  his  short  novel  Shaihu  Umar  (Elder  Umar),  the  protag-
onist’s students distract him from teaching them the Quran by 
asking him how he came to be a teacher. The story that follows 
is of his enslavement and its consequences: large-scale slave raids, 
kidnappings,  adoptions  by  childless  slavers,  and  more  kidnap-
pings. The protagonist finally meets up with his mother (she has 
been kidnapped and enslaved too, by the guards she had hired) 
in  Tripoli.  She  sees  that  he  is  pious  and  prosperous,  and  then 
she promptly dies. The vibe is that “people really will do terrible 
things for money” and that “the world is a Hobbesian war of all 
against all, but if you read the Quran really well, then you’ll prob-
ably prosper, maybe.”9

Balewa used his post as a traveling schools inspector to enter 
politics in Nigeria in the 1940s. He was one of the founders of the 
Northern People’s Congress. By 1952 he was colonial Nigeria’s 
minister of works. By 1957 he was prime minister. In 1960 he 
became prime minister of an independent and sovereign Nigeria. 
He was reelected in 1964. And then in January 1966 he was mur-
dered in the military coup led by the Young Majors—Chukwuma

Kaduna Nzeogwu and company—whose troops slaughtered se-
nior politicians and their generals and their wives, and then were 
themselves suppressed by a countercoup led by army commander 
Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi.

Aguiyi-Ironsi  was  assassinated  six  months  later  in  a  July 
counter-countercoup led by Yakuba Gowon. A year later the Igbo 
people  declared  the  independent  republic  of  Biafra,  which  was 
suppressed after a three-year war causing some 4 million deaths 
(out of a population of about 55 million), the overwhelming ma-
jority of them Igbo dead of starvation. Yakuba Gowon was over-
thrown by Murtala Muhammed in July 1975. And Murtala was 
then assassinated in February 1976. A return to civilian rule in 
1979 lasted only until 1983, when the next military coup took 
place in Nigeria.

WAS THE GLOBAL SOUTH richer in the 1990s than it had been in 
1911? Yes, much richer. Was the world more integrated in terms 
of trade, technology, and communication? Yes, by impressive de-
grees. But was the world more unequal? Yes, vastly so.

Who, or what, is to blame?
Some  insights  emerge.  Low  savings  rates  and  the  high  cost 
of capital investment meant that the yield from a given savings 
effort  in  the  global  south  was  low.  Because  poor  countries  are 
by definition those in which labor is cheap and machines are ex-
pensive, and all the more so when governments made foreign- 
produced machines hard to obtain, prices on most manufactured 
goods remained high. An incomplete demographic transition to 
low  fertility  (because  fear  of  poverty  translates  into  more  chil-
dren, in the hopes that some of them will look after the aged) 
meant high rates of population growth, which meant, in turn, 
that investment went to equip a growing labor force with all the 
basic tools they needed, rather than to the higher-quality tools

that would make a shrinking labor force productive. All of this 
brought about a general lack of education and entrepreneurship.
Vicious cycles abounded and were easily triggered. Virtuous 
cycles were rare and difficult to set in motion. Economic growth 
was held back by what the economist Michael Kremer has called 
the “O-ring property”: the more modern and the more poten-
tially  productive  the  division  of  labor  and  the  value  chain,  the 
more nearly everything had to go right for things to work. And 
if everything didn’t go right, substantial amounts of capital, re-
sources, and labor would be idle.

But what triggered the vicious cycles that opened and then 
widened the gap between the global north and the global south?
One short and too-simple answer is that the fault lies with  
governments—specifically,  with  governmental  institutions  that 
were “extractive” rather than “developmental,” in the currently 
fashionable  jargon  of  growth  economists.  We  are  talking  here 
about kleptocracy: government not by one ruler (monarchy), or 
by the self-proclaimed best (aristocracy), or by the people (democ-
racy), or by the rich (plutocracy)—but, rather, rule by thieves.

Yet kleptocracy is nothing new. Perhaps the major drawback 
to the invention of agriculture was that you had to be around to 
harvest the fields that you planted. This meant that you could 
not run away when thugs-with-spears came by to demand the 
lion’s share of your crops. And as this practice became general, 
people got into the business of supplying spears for the thugs, 
and the thugs began to organize hierarchically: we call the people 
at the top of the thug hierarchies “kings.” Thus, to fault the gov-
ernments of the global south ignores history. Most governments 
at  most  times  in  most  places  have  followed  policies  that  show 
little interest in nurturing sustained increases in productivity.

After all, the first priority of governments must be to prevent 
food riots in the capital. Regimes rule peacefully in part because 
they control the visible centers of sovereignty: those buildings in

the  capital  from  which  members  of  the  bureaucracy  expect  to 
receive  their  orders,  and  the  centrally  located  radio  and  televi-
sion broadcast sites through which rulers speak to their nations. 
If an urban riot overruns the president’s palace, the ministries, or 
the television stations, the government’s rule is in serious danger. 
Conversely, bread, circuses, and a well-supplied and compliant 
police force keep riots at bay. The second priority of governments 
is to keep the army well fed, well paid, and equipped with lots 
of new weapons to play with. Rulers can only rule so long as the 
army tolerates them. The third priority is to keep the bureaucrats 
and the political operatives content, and any potential opposition 
quiet or disorganized.

For insecure rulers, pursuing these aims almost always takes 
precedence over policy. All rulers believe they are the best peo-
ple for the job. Their rivals are at best incompetent, most likely 
wrongheaded and corrupt, and at worst amoral and destructive. 
As  these  insecure  rulers  see  it,  nothing  good  will  be  achieved 
for the country or the people unless they maintain their grip on 
power.  Only  after  the  government’s  seat  is  secure  will  debates 
about development policy take place. But the pursuit of a secure 
hold on power almost always takes up all the rulers’ time, energy, 
and resources. The life-span of the average government is often 
too short for any reasonable historian-critic to expect it to focus 
on long-run economic development.

And,  as  Niccolò  Machiavelli  wrote  in  his  little  book  about 
new princes back in the early 1500s, things are even worse with 
a new regime, in which the first task is currying supporters, who 
are unlikely to remain supporters unless they benefit.10 So, job 
number one in building a state is to seize control of and redirect 
benefits, tangible and otherwise, to the most influential of one’s 
supporters. And that process of seizure and redirection follows a 
different logic—a very different logic—than that of channeling 
resources to produce rapid economic growth.

False (and True) Starts to Economic Development in the Global South  

When  we  wonder  over  the  vast  inequality  between  global 
north and global south, perhaps the most pressing question isn’t 
who is to blame, or even what is to blame. It is more pragmatic: 
What needs to happen for growth to take place? For selfish and 
selfless reasons, most rulers would be benevolent if they thought 
they could be. Believing they could be requires stability and se-
curity, and increasing prosperity can be a powerful source of in-
creased stability and security.

But  why  don’t  potential  entrepreneurs—those  who  would 
beneﬁt  most  from  pro-development  policies,  and  whose  enter-
prises would in turn beneﬁt many others—work to overthrow an 
anti-development ruling regime? Political scientist Robert Bates 
asked this question of a cocoa farmer in Ghana. Bates was seeking 
to learn why farmers did not agitate for a reduction in the huge 
gap between the (very low) price the government paid them for 
cocoa and the (higher) price at which the government sold the 
cocoa on the world market. The farmer “went to his strongbox,” 
Bates reported, “and produced a packet of documents: licenses 
for his vehicles, import permits for spare parts, titles to his real 
property  and  improvements,  and  the  articles  of  incorporation 
that exempted him from a major portion of his income taxes. ‘If 
I tried to organize resistance to the government’s policies on farm 
prices,’  he  said  while  exhibiting  these  documents,  ‘I  would  be 
called an enemy of the state, and would lose all these.’”11

This  isn’t  always  or  only  an  accident  of  “overregulation.” 
From an economic development perspective, potential future en-
trants into industries produce the most social beneﬁt. Yet because 
they have no existing businesses or clients, they also have no re-
sources with which to lobby the influential. Therefore, from the 
perspective of those in power who wish to remain so, restricting

change rate has made foreign currency a scarce good, competition

from manufacturers abroad can also be easily strangled in select 
sectors as a favor to key existing businesses.

There is so much in addition that has driven the divergence 
between the global north and the global south that the respon-
sibility-attributing answers to “why?” and “what?” questions can 
only be unsatisfactory: strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, 
which leadeth unto prosperity in the global south. The “who?” 
question has a more straightforward answer: the global north, col-
lectively, had the wealth and power to take steps to arrange things 
more favorably for the global south, and it did not do so.

Successful  economic  development  depends  on  a  strong  but 
limited  government.  Strong  in  the  sense  that  its  judgments  of 
property  rights  are  obeyed,  that  its  functionaries  obey  instruc-
tions from the center, and that the infrastructure it pays for is 
built. And limited in the sense that it can do relatively little to 
help or hurt individual enterprises, and that political power does 
not become the only effective road to wealth and status.

Vignettes tell parts of a very few of the tales.

ONE OF THE MORE heartbreaking cases in the global south over 
the period from 1911 to 1990 is Argentina. In a very strong sense, 
Argentina has no business being a member of the global south 
today. In 1913 Buenos Aires was in the top twenty cities of the 
world in the likelihood that a typical resident had a telephone. 
In 1929 Argentina was in the top five economies in the world in 
the likelihood that a typical citizen owned an automobile. Of the 
countries that were its peers in the 1930s, most were overrun by 
or caught up in the turmoil of World War II. Argentinian politics 
in the 1930s was rough-and-tumble, with strong anti-democratic 
currents. But it was no worse than politics almost anywhere else, 
and better than politics in most other places. Strait was the gate.
Argentina’s leaders responded to the social and economic up-
heavals by adopting new policies aimed at stimulating demand

and redistributing wealth. At the same time, Argentina’s leaders 
became more distrustful of foreign trade and capital, and more 
inclined to use controls instead of prices as mechanisms to allo-
cate goods.12 What followed were spurts of growth that ended in 
monetary chaos and deep depression. Politics was nasty—“nasty” 
not  in  the  sense  of  people  arrested  but  in  the  sense  of  people 
simply “disappeared,” and “disappeared” in the sense of some of 
them murdered by being thrown out of helicopters.13

Such  was  the  persistent  environment  in  which  charismatic 
leaders could gain mass political support. One such, at the end 
of World War II, was Juan Perón. Perón’s policies were broadly 
popular:  his  government  increased  taxes,  created  agricultural 
marketing boards, supported unions, and regulated international 
trade. Perón sought to generate rapid growth and full employ-
ment  through  government  spending;  he  wanted  to  twist  terms 
of trade against exporters, agricultural oligarchs, foreigners, and 
entrepreneurs;  and  he  wanted  to  redistribute  wealth  to  urban 
workers, his most ardent supporters. After all, Argentina was a 
rich country: it could afford to treat its urban working class well.
Perón’s  program  produced  almost  half  a  decade  of  rapid 
growth.  Then  exports  fell  sharply.  The  international  business  
cycle has ups and downs, and it hit Argentina heavily, with a fall 
in demand for its exports. Reductions in prices of rural export-
ables then made themselves felt in reduced supply. Agricultural 
production fell because of low prices offered by the government 
for  agricultural  goods.  Domestic  consumption  rose.  The  rural 
sector found itself short of fertilizer and tractors. By the first half 
of the 1950s, the real value of Argentine exports dropped to only 
60 percent of the already low levels they had reached during the 
Depression, and only 40 percent of 1920s levels. And because 
Perón had twisted the terms of trade so drastically against agri-
culture and exportables, when the network of world trade was 
put back together in the 1950s, Argentina was no longer thickly 
connected.

The consequent foreign exchange shortage presented Perón 
with unattractive options. First, he could attempt to balance for-
eign payments by devaluing to bring imports and exports back 
into balance in the long run (and in the short run by borrowing 
from abroad). But effective devaluation would have entailed rais-
ing the real price of imported goods, and therefore cutting the 
living standards of the urban workers who made up his politi-
cal base. Foreign borrowing would have meant a betrayal of his 
strong nationalist position. Second, he could contract the econ-
omy,  raising  unemployment  and  reducing  consumption,  and 
expand  incentives  to  produce  for  export  by  easing  controls  on 
agricultural prices. But, once again, this would have required a 
reversal of the distributional shifts that had been his central aim.
The remaining option was one of controlling and rationing 
imports by government command. Not surprisingly, Perón and 
his advisers believed that a dash for growth and a reduction in 
dependence on the world economy was good for Argentina. It 
wasn’t. It wasn’t even good for Perón, who was deposed by the 
army (although he did retain high popularity among many, and 
did return as president in the years before his death in 1974). Sub-
sequent governments did not fully reverse these policies, for the 
political forces that Perón had mobilized still had to be appeased. 
Post–World War II Argentina saw foreign exchange allocated by 
the central government in order to, first, keep existing factories 
running and, second, keep home consumption high. Its third and 
last priority went to imports of capital goods for investment and 
capacity expansion.

One way to think about early post–World War II Argentina 
is that its mixed economy was poorly oriented: the government 
allocated goods, especially imports, among alternative uses; the 
controlled market redistributed income. Neither the private nor 
the public sector was used to its comparative advantage. As a re-
sult, the early 1950s saw a huge rise in the price of capital goods. 
Each percentage point of total product saved led to less than half

a  percentage  point’s  worth  of  investment.  Unable  to  invest  at 
scale, the Argentine economy fell behind the countries of West-
ern Europe. As the economy fell behind, discontent grew, and 
the government oscillated between overpromising politicians and 
undercompetent, murderous generals.

But could it be the case that Argentina’s slow-growth path 
was not an exception but the natural course? Could it be that 
Europe should view Argentina in the spirit of, “There but for 
the  grace  of  America  and  the  Marshall  Plan  go  we?”  With  a 
non-internationalist United States not so interested in fighting 
the Cold War, in restructuring Western Europe in general, or 
in a program of sustained support like the Marshall Plan, might 
Western Europe have followed a post–World War II trajectory 
similar to Argentina’s?14

Conversely, much of the global south would be justified in 
asking: What about us? In the presence of a global-north foreign- 
aid effort on the scale of the Marshall Plan, might the same vir-
tuous circles that lifted Western Europe likewise give life to the 
global economy’s periphery?

THE EXTREME DIFFICULTY OF mounting any substantial catch-  
up  to  the  global  north  is  reinforced  by  the  case  of  Reza  Shah 
Pahlavi and the Iranian Revolution.15 From the 1950s through 
the  1970s,  Iran  and  Reza  Shah  were  the  darling  of  many  who 
thought they were playing the Great Game of international pol-
itics: Reza Shah was strongly anti-communist and anti- Russian 
and  eager  to  “modernize”  Iran;  he  listened  to  global-north  ex-
perts,  especially  with  respect  to  the  importance  of  land  reform 
and engineers; and although he spent some of his oil revenues on 
luxuries, and more on the military, he channeled an even more 
substantial portion back into the economy of Iran.

Yes, pre-1979, the imperial Iranian government was, to put 
it bluntly, a tyranny. Yes, it had a ﬁerce and justifiably dreaded

secret police. But what precipitated the Iranian Revolution and 
led to the overthrow of the shah was not so much opposition to 
police or military strength. Religious ideology played a role, but 
not as large a role as many have assumed: afterward, most Iranians 
were  quite  surprised  at  the  fundamentalist  religious- ideological 
revolution they had helped make. The causes of the revolution 
had much more to do with the wealth and poverty created by the 
oil- and land-reform-based economic transformations that were 
put into place, who that wealth flowed to, who the poverty was 
inflicted upon, and the obstacles to successful economic develop-
ment that followed from those stresses.

In 1973, world oil prices tripled, and with the revenue from 
the  bonanza,  Reza  Shah  hoped  to  turn  Iran  into  an  industrial 
country in one generation. This meant, ﬁrst, land reform: distrib-
uting land to turn tenants and sharecroppers into independent 
farmers, and compensating landlords with government oil reve-
nues. But rapid population growth and a desire not to offend rich 
landlords too much meant that the plots distributed were small. 
At the same time, the boom in oil exports and the rise in oil prices 
together pushed up Iran’s exchange rate by a wide margin, and 
with an overvalued exchange rate it became proﬁtable to import 
food. So newly propertied peasant farmers found themselves with 
small plots selling their crops for declining prices.

They were supposed to become bulwarks of the regime, grate-
ful to it for distributing land. Instead, they scratched what they 
saw as an inadequate living off of too-small plots, or moved to 
the cities. While many Iranians saw their incomes growing rap-
idly in the years leading up to 1979, many others did not. Karl 
Polanyi would not have been surprised that the latter—those for 
whom things had not worked out as they had expected—were 
angrier than those who benefited from the windfalls, who were 
pleased by the changes that Reza Shah’s “White Revolution” had 
wrought. Certainly few in the street were willing to demonstrate 
or fight for it, however, or for him.

Moreover, as the world became smaller through advances in 
transportation  and  communications,  the  people  of  Iran  could 
see further into what was happening in other countries. For one 
thing,  rich  and  arrogant  Russians  and  Britons  and  Americans 
were showing up to walk their streets and their corridors of power 
and influence. Iranians had been used to seeing themselves at the 
center of an Islamic civilization that had been preeminent among 
world civilizations. They were now exposed to daily reminders 
that this was no longer the case. How were people to make sense 
of such a world?

Reza Shah Pahlavi’s answer was to try to turn Iranians into 
Europeans—that is, to follow an authoritarian state-led develop-
ment road reminiscent of pre–World War I Imperial Germany. 
But this left scant place for Islam. And the state that resulted was 
highly corrupt. Reza Shah’s reforms quickly proved problematic. 
Steps to emancipate women were unpopular among influential 
traditionalists.  And  although  the  shah  was  truly  committed  to 
turning Iran into a literate, educated, technologically proﬁcient 
country,  steps  to  boost  education  had  the  unintended  conse-
quence  of  producing  a  large  body  of  students  and  intellectuals 
attracted to revolutionary politics.

From exile, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini—a former op-
ponent  of  land  reform,  who  had  thought  it  was  un-Islamic  to 
dispossess landlords and free peasants from debt bondage—lit the 
fuse, calling on the Islamic clergy and the people to seize power 
from the despot and carry out an Islamic revolution. A forty-day 
cycle of demonstrations began, during which young religious ac-
tivists would be shot by the police, triggering another demonstra-
tion to mourn their deaths.

In January 1979 Reza Shah Pahlavi ﬂed into exile.
Thereafter,  Iran’s  economy  stagnated.  First  a  catastrophic 
decade- long war with Iraq—not started by Iran’s ayatollahs, but 
continued by them, as they believed God was on their side, that 
their cause was just, and that they could not but prevail— absorbed

tremendous  resources.  And  the  newly  dominant  religious  gov-
ernment  had  little  interest  in  economic  development:  its  leaders  
were  interested  in  paradise  in  heaven,  not  utopia  here  on  earth. 
The Iranian people had not made the Islamic Revolution to lower 
the price of watermelons—which was what Ayatollah Khomeini 
was reputed to have said in dismissal of the concerns of those of his 
advisers who wanted policies to bring material prosperity to Iran.

IF  ALL  THESE  OBSTACLES  to  rapid  and  successful  catch-up 
growth  were  not  enough,  there  were  also  the  pitfalls  produced 
by ideology: those seeking to create a utopia in a relatively short 
time by means of a complete societal transformation. The lure 
of  such  a  transformation  led  many  newly  independent  decolo-
nized governments in the 1950s and 1960s to follow the advice 
of intellectuals from the global north’s left—ultimately leading to 
prolonged difficulties.

This was only natural: the left had been, to its great credit, 
anti- colonial, while the center and the right, before World War 
II, and even today, have been imperialist. This had a very large 
influence on global-south development policy in the first post–
World  War  II  generation.  Marx  had  looked  forward  to  a  uto-
pia of free speech, democratic governments with equal political 
voice for all, great freedom of occupational and residential choice, 
and immense material wealth. The really-existing socialist gov-
ernments that the political left found itself associated with, the 
products of the Bolshevik revolution, had relatively little of any 
of these. Intellectuals on the left in the global north kept finding 
excuses to throw them over the side, one by one. And govern-
ments in the global south found themselves being told that the 
absence of these was a virtue: No freedom of speech? You could 
not mobilize the population to achieve the national purpose of 
development with conflicted caterwauling confusing the people, 
could you?

The core freedoms of Western society were always promised 
in  the  abstract.  There  would  be  free  speech,  government  with 
equal political voice, freedom to choose your job and your resi-
dence, and great wealth—someday. But those commitments were 
easily  delayed  because  of  the  exigencies  of  the  moment.  There 
was a need to shed the last vestiges of old colonial orders. There 
was  need  for  stability  first.  There  was  a  need  for  authoritarian 
command for national mobilization. And the delays became per-
manent. The era of transition was never-ending. There was a con-
stant emergency.

Until an educated and informed socialist electorate could be 
created, a centralized party was necessary in its place. It was—
mistakenly—thought by many in the newly decolonized nations, 
and by those who wished them well, that to rank representative 
institutions high on any list of the criteria of a good society was 
implicitly to attack decolonization and to defend the late colonial 
order. Nation-building required unity, and in new nations that 
unity could be fragile. If politicians and newspapers could whistle 
different tunes and criticize the government, this would disrupt 
that fragile unity. Then advocacy of private economic freedoms 
would disappear: all of the resources of society had to be mobi-
lized according to a single plan for rapid industrialization. Eggs 
would be broken. And as time pressed on, the habit of breaking 
them on whim grew. But no omelet appeared.

We see this dynamic most strikingly, most powerfully, and 
most destructively at work in the years after World War II in the 
really-existing socialist regimes of Asia, led by Maoist China.

Mao Zedong’s Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had unex-
pectedly won the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Its plan had been 
simple: arrive at a village, shoot the landlords, distribute the land. 
The peasants would then be richer than they had ever imagined—
and would support the CCP. The victory of the CCP then looks 
not  inevitable  but  understandable:  the  promise  of  release  from 
dire material poverty and from landlord tyranny was attractive,

and in its initial years the People’s Republic of China made good 
on this promise.

By the mid-1950s, however, a downward spiral had begun. 
Mao  and  company  were  predisposed  to  take  advice  from  their 
Soviet comrades. And so it was that when Stalin reenserfed the 
Russian peasants by collectivizing agriculture, Mao did the same. 
When  Stalin  brutally  suppressed  dissent  and  discussion  within 
and without the party, Mao quickly followed suit. However, when 
Stalin made heavy industrialization a priority by hiring technical 
advisers from outside, and copying plans from US and German 
factories, Mao took a slightly different route. Being more suspi-
cious of foreigners and less patient, he decreed that there would 
be a “Great Leap Forward.” To address China’s underdeveloped 
industrial  and  human  resources,  the  party  would  replace  the  
“material” factor with a “spiritual” one. What technocratic “ex-
perts”  said  could  not  be  done,  citing  material  limitations,  the 
“Red”  revolutionaries  would  do  by  force  of  conviction.  China 
would industrialize village by village, without imports of foreign 
capital goods or the advice of foreign engineers.16

Of course it was a disaster. To command—from the center—
that peasant farmers go out and build backyard blast furnaces to 
produce steel guarantees that you will get little steel and less grain. 
Worse, when the command comes directly from the dictator, you 
are guaranteed not to learn the truth. Because it was Mao him-
self who set out this policy, everyone reported back to him that 
the Great Leap Forward was proceeding magnificently. In reality, 
perhaps forty million people died in the ensuing famine.

This was, note, an even worse disaster than the standard disas-
ter that really-existing socialism turned out to be. If you walked 
along the edge of the Iron Curtain and then the Bamboo Cur-
tain  from  Leningrad  to  Odessa,  along  the  Caucasus,  and  then 
from Yunnan up to the Sea of Japan—or if you looked from re-
ally-existing socialist Cuba across the Caribbean to Costa Rica or 
Mexico—you  would  see  that  those  countries  where  the  armies

of Stalin or Mao or Kim Il-Sung or Ho Chi Minh or (shudder) 
Pol Pot had marched were, on average, only one-fifth as well-off 
when 1990 came and the curtains were raised as those that had 
been just beyond those armies’ reach. But Maoist China in the 
throes of the Great Leap Forward was worse than average.

As  the  extent  of  the  disaster  became  known,  Mao’s  prin-
cipal  lieutenants  moved  slowly  and  cautiously  against  him.  In 
December  1958,  Mao  was  replaced  by  Liu  Shaoqi  as  head  of 
state, with Deng Xiaoping at Liu’s right hand. At a conference 
in July 1959, Peng Dehuai, minister of defense, criticized Mao’s 
policies, and Mao threatened to split the party. The majority of 
the party members remained “loyal” to Mao. Peng Dehuai was 
condemned and dismissed from the party and the government. 
But Mao Zedong was also sidelined: the near-consensus of his 
deputies and their deputies was that Mao’s role should thereafter 
be ceremonial and symbolic. Mao did not agree.

Nevertheless,  it  took  six  years  before  Mao  could  arrange  a 
counterstrike. Eventually he managed to use his power as a sym-
bol  of  the  regime,  particularly  with  lower-level  cadres  and  the 
young, to return to command. His political counteroffensive was 
a call to “bombard the headquarters”—that is, to destroy anyone 
whose loyalty or revolutionary commitment he doubted within 
the leadership of the Communist Party, to wage a Cultural Rev-
olution.17  Liu  Shaoqi,  now  the  second-ranking  member  of  the 
Politburo Standing Committee, was killed. Deng Xiaoping was 
purged from the party and lost his leadership post for the heresy of 
claiming that it was more important to be competent than to be 
politically correct—“A good cat is not a cat that is black or white, 
a good cat is a cat that catches mice” (Mao feared that Deng meant 
his listeners to hear not “black” but “red”— revolutionary—and 
“white”—counterrevolutionary).  Perhaps  Deng  Xiaoping  es-
caped with his life by sheer luck. Mao’s Red Guards threw Deng 
Xiaoping’s  son,  Deng  Pufang,  out  of  a  window,  and  his  back 
was broken, causing permanent paraplegia. During the Cultural

Revolution,  universities  were  closed  so  that  curricula  could  be 
revised to better reflect Mao Zedong’s ideology. Engineers were 
sent to the countryside so they could learn how to perform ag-
ricultural  labor.  Technocrats  of  all  kinds  were  dismissed  from 
their jobs for similar reasons. The Cultural Revolution followed a 
strongly anti-intellectual ideology. Mao turned on his own tools 
next,  purging  the  leftist  ideologue-intellectuals.  In  1971,  the  
new second-ranking member of the Chinese Communist Party’s 
Politburo Standing Committee, Lin Biao, fled before Mao could 
purge him, dying in a plane crash.

Mao’s Cultural Revolution, much like his Great Leap For-
ward,  continued  until  his  death  in  1976.  We  do  not  know  its 
human cost—perhaps as many as 1.5 or 2 million people were 
killed, and perhaps tens of millions of others were purged and/
or imprisoned. We can also estimate that in 1970—after the first 
phase of the Cultural Revolution—China’s level of material pros-
perity was perhaps half that of India’s, having become the rough 
equivalent of today’s level of material well-being in the very poor-
est countries on earth. In the end, Deng Xiaoping returned from 
his purge and exile to take up the reins. He was the only person 
able to govern with credibility among both the bureaucratic cad-
res and the military, for many of them still knew him well.18 Only 
then he was purged again. And this time, his only shield against 
the wrath of the Gang of Four, the Maoist political faction that 
implemented  his  policies,  was  either  his  military  allies  or  Mao 
himself, before their overthrow after Mao’s death.

Only two things ultimately rescued China and its economy. 
The first was twofold: the failure of Mao’s armies to conquer Tai-
wan, and his unwillingness in 1949 to pick a fight with Great 
Britain  to  attack  Hong  Kong.  Taiwan  and  Hong  Kong  subse-
quently provided China with the entrepreneurs and the mobiliz-
ers of finance for industrial development that it needed to grow 
after 1978. The second was Deng Xiaoping. Deng had certainly 
not been an advocate of a return to the market economy when he

was purged in 1966—indeed, he was not at all what Mao’s Red 
Guards called him: the “number 2 person in authority taking the 
capitalist road.” But he certainly was the number-one person in 
authority  taking  the  capitalist  road  after  his  accession  to  para-
mountcy in 1978. And that was to make a huge difference. Once 
in power, he gave the baton to Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Xi 
Zhongzun, and other reformers to find a way forward to restore 
and then develop China’s economy. And so the government of 
China found its way forward after Mao’s death. Mao claimed that 
he had made China stand up, but that was false. It was Deng who 
did the job.

FROM  A  CYNICAL  PERSPECTIVE,  perhaps  the  most  interesting 
question about emerging economies is not why they have so fre-
quently stagnated or experienced precipitous declines, but why 
they have sometimes experienced rapid growth. Chile, Mexico, 
southern Brazil, and Panama in Latin America; Algeria in Sa haran 
and Botswana in sub-Saharan Africa; and Hong Kong, Malaysia, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and now, of course, 
post-Mao China in Asia have all made impressive strides toward 
closing  the  relative  material  prosperity  gap  vis-à-vis  the  global 
north in the post–World War II era. How have they managed 
to do this? What have been the key factors separating successful 
from unsuccessful episodes of economic development?

So we now turn in a more hopeful and positive direction. 
There were two groups of countries that did manage to catch up 
to global-north norms in the years after 1950. The first comprised 
the countries that were the original members of the Organisation 
for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  now 
thought  of  as  a  rich-country  club,  but  not  so  much  at  its  be-
ginning—the member countries were largely Marshall Plan aid 
recipients and British settler dominions, along with Japan and

the East Asian Pacific Rim. It is on these that we’ll now focus 
our attention.

The speed of Japan’s recovery after 1950 surprised many.19 
Immediately after World War II, it remained unclear whether its 
economy would successfully surmount the shock of defeat. With 
its factories leveled, without oil or iron, starting from ground zero 
and having to purchase from abroad nearly every input needed 
for industrial civilization, save rice and coal, what were Japan’s 
chances?  Things  changed  when  the  Korean  War,  starting  in 
1950, made Japanese industry a valuable hot-war resource, which 
in turn made Japanese economic success an important Cold War 
goal. It became a keystone of US policy that Japan become a pros-
perous, democratic, and unsinkable ally in the troubled regions of 
East Asia. By 1955, the Japanese economy was as strong as it had 
been on December 7, 1941. And growth thereafter was the fastest 
the world had hitherto seen.

From 1960 to 1973, the Japanese economy grew at an average 
rate of 10 percent annually, quadrupling the economy in a short 
sprint and raising GDP per capita from the equivalent of 25 per-
cent of the US economy to 57 percent. In the next period, 1973 
to 1990, the country’s GDP grew at an average rate of 4.5 percent 
annually, doubling the economy again and bringing Japanese per 
capita GDP up to the equivalent of 78 percent of the US economy.
How did Japan achieve such a stunning period of sustained 
growth? A significant part of the plan was a policy of strong do-
mestic  protectionism  through  an  intricate  network  of  non-tar-
iff  economic  and  social  network  barriers.  Economists  generally 
oppose protectionism, because it hurts consumers (by increasing 
prices) while benefiting producers (who have done nothing pro-
ductive to earn it). An economy of protectionism produces firms 
that are good at getting what they want out of the capital, but 
inefficient  and  often  bad  at  developing  new  technologies.  It  is 
true that Japan’s protectionism did have some such elements—
but Japanese protection was, it seemed, smart policy. Over time

it appears that producers gained enough to offset the static losses. 
Overpaying, they grew rich.

After  the  fact,  global-north  observers  rationalized  continu-
ance of the policy. Japan, they thought, was very special: it had 
entered the modern age with a strong, functional government, an 
elite that rapidly saw the need for westernization, a population 
expanding at a modest enough rate that it was not in danger of 
going hungry, a deep respect for commerce and industry, and an 
enthusiasm for mass education. But Japan seemed to be the only 
East  Asian  country  where  all  of  these  conditions  were  present. 
The societal transformation undertaken during the Meiji Resto-
ration  of  the  mid-1800s  had  no  parallel  elsewhere  in  what  the 
global  north  saw  as  a  culturally  static  and  bureaucratically  and 
hierarchically ossified region.

Back in 1945, most outside observers regarded East Asia, with 
the exception of Japan, the way observers today regard Africa: as 
the part of the globe facing the biggest development challenges, 
and most likely to stay poor. The rest of the region seemed to face 
incredibly long odds. So the Pacific Rim’s rapid economic growth 
in the latter half of the long twentieth century was nothing short 
of  miraculous.  Many  countries  have  attempted  to  grow  their 
economies  rapidly  under  the  aegis  of  a  “developmental  state.” 
Yet, most of the time, these efforts have failed.

Why were East Asian countries any different? One reason is 
that other “developmental states,” including those in Latin Amer-
ica, and to some extent those in the Soviet bloc, were designed, 
above all else, to achieve independence and self-sufficiency. They 
walled their economies off from world market prices and, indeed, 
from prices altogether. East Asia started with the assumption that 
it would have to export—and export big-time—if only because 
its resources were thin and scarce.

The  goal  was  not  to  forge  a  new  economic  path;  the  goal 
was simply to catch up. The global north believed it possessed 
the secret sauce to running an efficient, growing, and innovative

technological frontier economy, but there is no a priori reason 
to think that the economic organization best suited to inventing 
the industrial future should be the same as the one best suited to 
catching up to a known target.

The king of England did not call a meeting of barons, bish-
ops, bankers, and a few mechanics and say, “Let’s have an Indus-
trial Revolution.” But that is pretty much what Japan did at the 
beginning of the long twentieth century with its reforms under 
the Meiji Restoration. This strategy succeeded. And Japan then 
provided a model for how its ex-colonies, South Korea and Tai-
wan, should attempt to play catch-up under their dictators (Park 
Chung-Hee and Chiang Kai-shek, respectively), which then pro-
vided  models  for  Malaysia,  Thailand,  and  others.  The  verdict 
is  very  clear:  for  catch-up  development,  whatever  it  is  that  the  
“Pacific Rim development model” is, it works.

What defines this model? First, trade, but managed trade. 
Undervalue the exchange rate, so that you can export manufac-
tures that are not, initially at least, up to global-north quality 
standards. And then channel subsidies to companies that have 
successfully exported—the ones to which global-north middle- 
class  consumers  award  the  prizes.  Those  same  Japanese  firms 
that were protected against imports from abroad were, in inter-
national markets, forced to hone their competitive abilities and 
match international standards of innovation, quality, and price. 
Very patient cheap capital helped. And by the 1980s it was clear 
that protectionism had yielded incredible results. Indeed, some-
thing remarkable was going on with Kawasaki and Nippon in 
Steel;  Toyota,  Nissan  and  Honda  in  automobiles;  eventually 
Bridgestone in tires; Komatsu in construction equipment; and 
Toshiba,  Matsuhita  (Panasonic),  and  Nikon,  Fujitsu,  Sharp, 
Sony, and Canon in electronics.

In Latin America, an overvalued exchange rate would see a 
lot of society’s wealth spent on the purchase of foreign luxuries,

as the upper class preferred to live well rather than channel its 
resources into national development. In these instances, the strat-
egy that Latin American leaders chose was to use high tariffs and 
non-tariff barriers to restrict imports of intermediate goods and 
capital machines needed, at a heavy cost to production and for 
economic development.

But back to Japan: Add a high rate of savings, sustained year 
after year, coming from an equal post-land-reform income distri-
bution and channels—such as a postal savings system, where post 
offices across the country were used as consumer banks with the 
ability to accept deposits, make loans, and provide a variety of 
other financial services—that made savings easy, in an environ-
ment where people could be confident that their savings would 
not disappear. Ensure that the sellers of machines to the firms 
that took out loans from these banks charged low prices—so that 
buyers did not have to pay high prices to domestic machine pro-
ducers,  or  higher  prices  to  those  lucky  enough,  and  politically 
well-connected enough, to have scrounged scarce import licenses, 
and  so  had  foreign-made  machines  to  sell.  Tilt  the  economy’s 
price structure so that machines that embodied modern techno-
logical knowledge were cheap, and foreign-made and luxurious 
consumption goods were expensive.

Taking  these  steps  would  mean,  of  course,  heavy,  hidden 
taxes on labor, and especially on skilled labor. They would also 
mean  financial  repression  relative  to  what  “free-market”  prices 
would have been: squeezing returns to savers, and shifting those 
returns to the industrial companies that accessed the savings, and 
to those who ended up owning them. And they would mean ex-
port surpluses via undervalued exchange rates—subsidies relative 
to Smithian prices to foreigners who purchased the exports—in 
the  hope  that  the  human-  and  organizational-capital  gains,  via 
learning-by-doing  from  producing  exports  successfully,  would 
outweigh the cost of the implicit subsidies.

The lesson of history throughout the Pacific Rim is that as 
long  as  exports  earn  enough  dollars  for  domestic  businesses  to 
obtain access to the global-north-produced machines they need, 
and the global-north-invented technologies they embody, and as 
long as the machines go to firms that are efficient and effective, 
this formula enables a country to advance.

And this is why it is important that subsidies go to compa-
nies that successfully export—pass a market-efficiency test, albeit 
a  market-efficiency  test  applied  not  in  some  home  free-market 
economy, but among the import-purchasing middle classes of the 
global north.

Ultimately, the East Asian developmental model is predicated 
on other nations—cough, the United States of America—being 
able to absorb exports and run trade deficits because they are op-
erating on a different, open economy model. Could the United 
States have absorbed everyone’s exports, had everyone attempted 
this?  No.  The  model  could  only  ever  have  worked  for  a  small 
handful of countries.

Yet it did work. Consider South Korea, now home to one of 
the two most efficient high-tech microprocessor-building factory 
complexes of the world, Samsung. As noted above, no one watch-
ing South Korea in the 1950s anticipated that it would become 
one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. At the time, it had 
just been devastated by a bitter war, during which its capital and 
major industrial center, Seoul, had changed hands four times. Its 
savings rate was low. Its exports were low. More than half of its 
imports in the late 1950s were paid for by US assistance, either in 
the form of foreign aid or expenditures to support the US military 
presence in South Korea.

The government of President Syngman Rhee in 1948–1960 
sought to control the flow of foreign affairs and imports. It over-
valued  Korea’s  currency  (so  as  to  charge  the  United  States  as 
much as possible for support of its military), imposed high tariffs, 
and implemented stringent quantitative import restrictions. The

results were slow and erratic growth and continued dependence 
on the United States. With the takeover of the government by 
Park Chung-Hee in 1961, everything changed. Park was brutal 
(although not extraordinarily so by the standards of the twenti-
eth  century)  but  remarkably  effective.  The  shift  of  Korea’s  de-
velopment  strategy  from  one  of  import  substitution  to  one  of 
export-led  industrialization  was  very  rapid.  The  consequences 
were  astounding.  Exports  grew  from  3  percent  of  GDP  to  40 
percent of GDP. The growth rate of income per capita averaged 
more than 7 percent of GDP for the three decades after 1960.

Even  where  rapid  growth  would  seem  to  have  been  swim-
ming against the regional political-economic tide, it was possible. 
The shining beacon is Botswana, with an annual real income per 
capita estimated at $900 in 1960 and $14,000 in 2010. Then it 
had the highest Human Development Index in sub-Saharan Af-
rica, despite being landlocked, despite being severely affected by 
HIV/AIDS, and despite being in a regional neighborhood that 
has done very poorly in terms of economic growth.20 Its neigh-
bor Zambia’s income per capita went from $2,800 in 1960 to 
$3,500 in 2010, from three times Botswana’s to one-fourth of 
Bots wana’s. In Botswana, an independent and uncorrupt judicial 
system, a lack of tariffs on machinery imports (to encourage tech-
nology transfer), a banking system that encouraged savings, and 
a policy of plowing back government revenues into infrastructure 
investment all helped. So did the luck and the skill of the Tswana 
chiefs in the late 1800s in managing to guide the British Empire 
into ruling with a very light hand, which made post- independence 
state-building  very  easy.  And  the  fact  that  Botswana’s  popula-
tion was about 80 percent Tswana, as was the leader of the in-
dependence  movement  and  the  first  president  of  independent 
Botswana (1966–1980), Seretse Khama, kgosi (“king” or “chief”) 
of the Ngwato, one of the eight principal Tswana chieftaincies. 
Not to mention that Botswana negotiated a 50 percent owner-
ship interest in the country’s De Beers mining subsidiary, plus a

15 percent ownership stake in the overall De Beers corporation. 
Any country, anywhere, could have done it, if Botswana could.

RECALL  ROBERT  ALLEN’S  CHECKLIST  for  successful  develop-
ment:  promote  markets,  build  railroads  and  canals  and  ports, 
charter banks, teach children, teach engineers, impose tariffs on 
commodities, and nurture the creation of communities of engi-
neering practice. Finally, once all those conditions are met, pro-
vide,  from  somewhere,  a  Big  Push,  to  create  expectations  that 
there  will  be  growth.  The  Pacific  Rim  added  its  own  special 
sauces—but nevertheless, the key gap between the Pacific Rim 
and the rest of the global south was due to its successful imple-
mentation of the obvious. Carl von Clausewitz wrote, famously, 
about war: “Everything is very simple in war, but the simplest 
thing  is  difficult.  These  difficulties  accumulate  and  produce  a 
friction,  which  no  man  can  imagine  exactly  who  has  not  seen 
it.”21  The  same  has  held  true  of  economic  development  nearly 
everywhere in the global south.

Moreover,  the  logic  of  politics  is  that  of  favors  performed, 
wealth  redistributed,  inﬂuence  exercised,  and  taxes  collected. 
That is very different from the logic of economic growth. A state 
that  is  still  emerging  and  establishing  itself  cannot  successfully 
midwife economic development. Only a state that is limited in 
the amount of damage it can do to the economy, or a state that 
is secure enough, independent enough, and committed enough 
to  rapid  economic  growth,  can  avoid  these  political  survival 
traps.  Therefore,  what  is  needed  is  either  a  stringently  limited 
government—one  incapable  of  redistributing  resources  to  fa-
vored clients, because its economy is so integrated into the global 
economy and so governed by its norms, laws, and treaties—or 
a  functioning  developmental  state.  Either  “neoliberal”-style  in-
ternational  market-led  development,  or  Pacific  Rim–style  gov-
ernance and growth. And attempting the latter is very risky. As 
economist Lant Pritchett likes to say, “There are few things in

the world that are worse than state-led development led by an 
anti-development state.”22

That was what too many post-independence Asian and Af-
rican states, and too many post–World War II Latin American 
states, turned out to be.

So suppose that a global-south economy does not want to risk 
trying, and failing, to follow the Pacific Rim model. Is there an-
other approach it could follow? What if you simply cannot create 
a government bureaucracy whose first goal is development?

For many what remains as the only viable option—and this 
is a counsel of despair—is “neoliberalism.” What this means in 
practice is less clear than what it means in desired consequence: 
the  goal,  at  least,  is  to  insulate  the  economy  from  the  (semi- 
predatory) government, so that the government’s attempts to tilt 
the distribution of income in favor of the politically powerful are 
relatively ineffective and so do little harm. Starting in the 1980s, 
hopes for development did indeed shift in the direction of this 
“neoliberalism.” Because it seemed like the state’s interventions 
were more likely to be destructive than constructive, people who 
thought themselves wise deemed it better to try to limit the state’s 
involvement  in  the  process  of  development.  Rely  instead,  they 
advised, on the world market as a source of demand, and on the 
requirements for integration into the world market as a source of 
good-enough governance.

These pressures, taking the post–World War II period as a 
whole, at least, have been strong enough to counteract the natu-
ral tendency for poor countries to learn rapidly about technology 
and catch up to rich ones. There is no clear reason on the horizon 
for these pressures to diminish. Optimists hope that the record of 
economic failure provided by much third world experience in the 
past generation will lead to the creation of intellectual pressures 
for  reform  strong  enough  to  overcome  the  bias  for  stagnation. 
And if ideas truly are the decisive forces making history in the 
long run, perhaps the optimists are right.

If  the  optimists  are  wrong,  then  we  are  all  in  big  trouble. 
Successful  handling  of  global  warming  and  other  future  global 
environmental  problems,  and  successful  long-run  stabilization 
of human populations, hinges on successful industrialization in 
the global south and their consequent—rapid—passage through 
the demographic transition, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and 
in much of the Islamic world, where it is currently semi-stalled. 
“Neoliberalism” in the global south has thus been the strategy of 
pessimistic optimists. Having grown pessimistic about the ability 
of developing states to attain enough security, stability, and inde-
pendence to pursue economic growth, they optimistically expect 
evidence  of  economic  failure  to  generate  ideas,  constituencies, 
and  pressures  that  will  reform  states  toward  economic  growth. 
Pessimism in the short run—but optimism in the long.

A s we have seen, in the years before the beginning of the long 

twentieth century, from roughly 1800 to 1870, new devel-
opments in technology and organization seemed to be opening 
the door to a better world, one in which humanity would not be 
kept desperately poor by the Malthusian trap. As the long twen-
tieth century began, humanity started to walk through that door, 
along the path to the utopia beyond. But in the following years, 
1914–1949 or so, the utopia beyond the door proved elusive as 
humanity grappled with a world war, a major depression, and an-
other world war. There were also civil and revolutionary wars—
and the last of these, China’s, which did not come to an end until 
1949, brought with it a famine in which between fifty million 
and one hundred million people died throughout the country. 
Technology and organization, rather than acting as forces to free 
and enrich, were increasingly used to kill and oppress.

If  one  looked  only  at  the  ideological  challenges,  the  politi-
cal  mechanisms,  and  the  dilemmas  of  growth  and  distribution 
during this period, one would not have found much of a basis for 
optimism in the immediate aftermath of World War II.

And yet, after World War II, the world, or at least the global 
north, picked up its mat and walked—nay, ran—forward toward

true utopia. High taxes to fight wars had fallen most heavily upon 
the rich, who had also seen their wealth substantially reduced by 
the  Great  Depression.  In  the  United  States,  an  enormous  de-
mand for workers to build capacity for the war had driven up 
wages—and compressed them, too. The wages of the “unskilled” 
rose more than the wages of the “skilled,” both because the War 
Labor  Board  decreed  it  so  and  because  those  running  the  fac-
tories were under immense pressure to get the job done, and it 
turned  out  to  be  not  that  difficult  to  teach  skills  if  you  really 
needed to. And in the aftermath of World War II, strong unions 
everywhere  made  it  economically  risky  for  bosses  to  claim  or 
boards to approve extraordinary compensation packages for high 
executives. Growth was faster than ever before, unemployment 
was low, incomes were not too unequally distributed—at least 
if you were a white guy who had been born in the United States 
or some other country of the global north—and the boom-bust 
business cycle was very moderate. It was closer to material utopia 
for white guys in the global north than ever before, and rapidly 
getting closer still.

But still, this was only true for white guys. For everyone else? 
In most places, for most people, it’s true that things were better 
than in the times of their predecessors. As the Nigerian novelist 
Chinua  Achebe  wrote,  putting  himself  in  the  place  of  his  col-
onized  Igbo  ancestors,  “The  white  man  had  indeed  brought  a 
lunatic religion, but he had also built a trading store and for the 
first time palm-oil and kernel became things of great price, and 
much money flowed into Umofia.”1 But close to utopia? Not so 
much. And yet, although huge gaps remained between the white 
guys who were full citizens of the global north and other guys 
who were not, the derivative was in the right direction: things did 
get somewhat better for those who were not.

W. Arthur Lewis was born on the British-ruled island of Saint 
Lucia in 1915. He was a gifted student who finished high school 
at the age of fourteen. He wanted to become an engineer, but, as

he later wrote, “This seemed pointless since neither the govern-
ment nor the white firms would employ a black engineer.”2 He 
decided to go into business administration and won a scholarship 
that enabled him to become the first African-heritage student at 
the  London  School  of  Economics  in  1933.  The  economists  at 
the LSE recognized immense talent. In 1953 he was promoted 
to full professor at the University of Manchester and was consid-
ered perhaps the leading development economist in the world. 
In 1959 he was appointed vice chancellor of the University of 
the West Indies and returned to the Americas. But Lewis did not 
see his success as in any way validating the system. He was a stri-
dent advocate for reparations and always sought to bring the issue 
of “underdevelopment” to the forefront. Underdevelopment, he 
said,  was  not  a  lack  of  economic  change,  but  rather  a  form  of 
economic change—one imposed on the global south by how the 
market economy had globalized.3

For a long, long time, reaching back into human history, it 
was  the  case  that  a  person  could  have  social  power  only  if  he 
was male, and even then only if he was special—from the right 
tribe, the right caste, the right lineage, or the right social order, or 
had enough property, or enough education. This was how peo-
ple expected it would always be—unless, as Aristotle theorized, 
humans obtained the fantasy technologies of the Golden Age, by 
which he meant something akin to utopia. To quote Aristotle, 
“Chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves,” 
once “every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying 
or anticipating the will of others, like the [blacksmithing] statues 
of Daidalos, or the three-wheeled catering serving-carts of Hep-
haistos.”4  Until  then,  Malthusian  demographic  pressure  along 
with an anemic pace of invention would keep productivity low. 
If some were to have the leisure to, as John Adams put it, study 
philosophy, painting, poetry, and music, others—most—would 
have to be degraded and deprived of social power, and a good 
chunk of what they produced would be taken from them.

Gross  inequality  did  not  mean  that  status  was  fixed  across 
generations. For much of Agrarian Age history, in many places, 
such status was malleable: you or your father could change it—if 
you were or he was lucky. The centurion stops, turns to the tri-
bune, and says, “This man is a Roman citizen,” and the beating 
that  Saint  Paul  is  about  to  receive  is  immediately  prevented—
never mind that he has it because his father did some favor for 
or paid some bribe to a Roman magistrate, and that none of his 
ancestors had ever seen Rome.

As time passed, and the Imperial-Commercial Age progressed, 
Europe increasingly chose violence: the Atlantic slave trade grew, 
and perhaps seventeen million people were kidnapped from Af-
rica and brought to the Americas to be enslaved, and, mostly, to 
be worked to death or near death. We think life expectancy as 
a Black slave in the Caribbean before 1800 was perhaps seven 
years  once  they  arrived  and  were  put  to  work.  Guilt  grew  in 
Europe: this was a crime—a very profitable crime—unless there 
was some reason that Africans deserved to be enslaved. W. E. B. 
Du Bois lamented this history in his 1910 essay “The Souls of 
White Folk”:

The discovery of personal whiteness among the world’s peo-
ples is a very modern thing. . . . Even the sweeter souls of the 
dominant world as they discourse with me . . . are continu-
ally playing above their actual words an obligato of tune and 
tone, saying:

“My poor, un-white thing! Weep not nor rage. I know, too 
well, that the curse of God lies heavy on you. Why? That is 
not for me to say, but be brave! Do your work in your lowly 
sphere, praying the good Lord that into heaven above, where 
all is love, you may, one day, be born—white!”5

As a matter of genetic fact, the overwhelming bulk of the hu-
man race’s genes passed through a very narrow bottleneck some

75,000 years ago, so much so that the overwhelming bulk of us 
receive  the  overwhelming  bulk  of  our  genes  from  a  few  thou-
sands alive then.6 They are all of our great- (multiply that word 
by  3,000)  grandparents.  Do  the  math,  and  discover  that  the 
number of slots in each of our family trees divided by the num-
ber of ancestral people alive back then is a number that begins 
153,778,990,270  and  then  continues  with  another  888  digits, 
approximately 1.5 x 1099. The average person alive 75,000 years 
ago who is among our collective ancestors—who has any living 
descendants today—thus not only fills more slots in that genera-
tion of each of our ancestral family trees than there are particles in 
the universe, but more than there are particles in a billion billion 
universes. Which means that if a human from 75,000 years ago 
has living descendants today, the odds are overwhelming that we 
are all descended from that individual, and descended through 
myriads upon myriads upon myriads of lines. Thus all humans 
are close cousins: there is reputed to be more genetic variation in 
a typical baboon troop than in the entire human race.

Yes,  humans  have  coevolved  with  culture  and  geography. 
Those  of  us  whose  ancestors  moved  far  from  the  equator  are 
descended only from those among the migrants who developed 
mutations  disrupting  their  melanin-production  genes,  so  that 
enough sunlight could get through the outer layers of the skin 
to  turn  cholesterol  into  Vitamin  D.  It  looks  as  though  lactose 
tolerance has evolved six times in the past 6,000 years. Yes, we 
wish right now that whatever founder effects produced Tay-Sachs 
disease had not occurred.

Some  believe  that  there  are  important  genetic  differences 
between the sociological group divisions that we draw between 
different groups of our very close cousins—and that these differ-
ences explain other differences in social, political, cultural, and, 
yes, economic outcomes among genders and ethnicities. As the 
right-wing economist Thomas Sowell pointed out long ago, to 
no effect in the corridors of the Hoover Institution, “Progressive”

Anglo-Saxons  in  1900  thought  it  was  extremely  important  to 
restrict immigration to keep the feeble-minded Jews of Eastern  
Europe from coming to America.7

It is exhausting, indeed debasing, to many, to have to expend 
effort refuting claims that, for example, Black Americans living in 
relative poverty today face those circumstances because, as a group, 
they have inherited genes for dumbness. As a rule, those who are 
“just asking questions” are not doing so because they wish to learn 
about inheritance, population genetics, and the inter generational 
transmission  of  inequality.  Perversely,  any  effort  to  rebut  such 
claims  tends  to  trigger  a  “where  there  is  smoke,  there  must  be 
fire” reaction, rather than exposing the emptiness of the idea. It 
is a hard problem, how to conduct rational public discourse in 
a  twenty-first  century  in  which  communications  channels  such 
as Facebook and Twitter are run by those whose business model 
it is to scare and outrage their readers in order to glue their eye-
balls to a screen so they can then be sold fake diabetes cures and 
cryptocurrencies.8

Perhaps these views are so persistent because they have such 
deep  roots  in  US  history.  Abraham  Lincoln—a  politician  and 
statesman much more committed to the dignity of labor and to 
the  equality  of  humanity  than  most—spoke  to  the  issue  in  an 
1858 campaign speech: “I have no purpose to introduce political 
and social equality between the white and the black races. There 
is a physical difference between the two, which, in my judgment, 
will probably forever forbid their living together upon the footing 
of perfect equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that 
there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in fa-
vor of the race to which I belong having the superior position.”9
As a matter of economic history, this meant that after World 
War II, when the global north picked up its mat and ran toward 
utopia, white men were given a vast head start vis-à-vis all other 
men  and  all  women.  But,  for  Lincoln,  full-throated  assertions 
that he meant to protect white supremacy were, in context, more

anticipatory  concessive  throat-clearing  than  a  line  in  the  sand. 
They were the lead-up to a “but.” The core meaning of his speech 
came later, after the “but.” In Lincoln’s view, Black Americans 
deserved—and  more  importantly,  had  inalienable  rights  to—a 
much better deal than they were getting: “There is no reason in 
the world why the negro is not entitled to all the natural rights 
enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. . . . In the right to eat the 
bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand 
earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the 
equal of every living man.”10 The record then shows that from 
the white audience of the citizens of Illinois who were seeking 
entertainment and information about their state’s Senate race on 
that summer Saturday afternoon, there came “Great Applause.”

Whatever inequalities might exist in society, the right for you 
to make somebody else your slave was not one of them, Lincoln 
was  saying.  You  only  had  a  right  to  eat  what  you  had  earned 
by the work of your hands. That was part of your rights to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To keep others from tak-
ing the bread that you had earned was the point of government. 
Moreover,  any  such  government  was  legitimate  only  through 
your consent.

That was the theory. But, as Martin Luther King Jr. would 
later put it in his famous 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech, the 
writers of the Declaration of Independence and the United States 
Constitution had signed a “promissory note” to Black Americans 
that was still in arrears then, and is still in arrears today.11 Think 
of it: one-half of US states currently have election laws crafted to 
diminish the voting power of Black people and to make it dispro-
portionately burdensome and inconvenient for them to exercise 
their franchise. And, no, you cannot make a society that keeps 
Blacks poor and enact policies that make them prefer to vote for 
Democratic candidates and then claim that there is no racial ani-
mus in the disparate impact of vote suppression.12

Nevertheless,  Lincoln’s  Emancipation  Proclamation  was  a 
mighty  blow  that  made  visible  a  glacial  creep  toward  what  we 
now call “inclusion.” And throughout the long twentieth century, 
things have at least started to change. As the century advanced, 
being a male and being of the right tribe, the right caste, the right 
lineage, or a member of the right social order became less and less 
essential for social power.

But  having  property  and  education  (and  the  right  amounts 
and kinds of both) remained crucial. Where a person was born 
continued  to  be  decisive  in  shaping  what  their  opportunities 
would be. Throughout the long twentieth century, in other words, 
“inclusion” continued to be more goal than reality.

In the long twentieth century’s social movement toward in-
clusion, the United States was once more, to a substantial degree, 
the furnace where the future was being forged. It was not that the 
United States did better than other countries. But the combina-
tion of the its global hegemonic power and the larger gap between 
its aspirations and its reality generated a great deal of high-tension 
energy. Or so it had been since the United States decided that it 
would  be  defined  by  Thomas  Jefferson’s  declaration—that  “all 
men are created equal” and “endowed . . . with certain unalien-
able Rights”—rather than Roger B. Taney’s—that Black people 
were “so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man 
was bound to respect.”13

AT THE END OF World War II, all indications were that a combi-
nation of de jure and de facto discrimination against Black Amer-
icans would continue indefinitely to prevent them from attaining 
education,  climbing  out  of  poverty,  and  building  wealth.  The 
economist and sociologist Gunnar Myrdal entitled his 1944 book 
on race and America An American Dilemma—the dilemma be-
ing the inconsistency between an “American creed” of equality of

opportunity and the actual position of Blacks in America. There 
seemed to be no reason why the country could not live with this 
dilemma indefinitely.

The  Republican  Party  retained  a  vestigial  commitment  to 
Black uplift as part of its belief in “free labor.” But the Ameri-
can aspiration to equality managed to coexist with official state- 
sanctioned  discrimination  and  disenfranchisement  for  another 
full century. In the South, Black disenfranchisement was settled 
policy, overwhelmingly popular among whites. Eight Blacks from 
the South served in Congress between 1875 and 1877, but then 
there would be no southern Black representatives from 1901 to 
1973, when Barbara Jordan from Texas and Andrew Young from 
Georgia took office.

In  the  North,  up  until  the  beginning  of  the  first  Great  
Migration in the 1910s, there were too few Blacks in the popula-
tion for the election of a Black representative to be likely, and so 
there were none. Even after the migration was underway, there 
were very few Black congressmen from the North. Indeed, the 
first northern Black congressman did not take office until 1929, 
when a Republican, Oscar Stanton De Priest, was elected from a 
majority-minority district in Southside Chicago. A second Black 
congressman, Adam Clayton Powell from Harlem, took office in 
1945. Then came Charles Diggs from Michigan in 1955, Robert 
Nix from Pennsylvania in 1959, Augustus Hawkins from Cali-
fornia in 1963, and John Conyers from Michigan in 1965. In 
short, there were only four Black congressmen, all Democrats, 
in  the  last  Congress  before  the  passage  of  the  landmark  1965 
Voting Rights Act, which finally provided a meaningful set of 
protections for Black voters.

And yet, today, nearly half of the states have voting restric-
tions  targeted  at  reducing  the  share  of  Black  votes.  A  majority 
of US Supreme Court justices pretend to believe that these are 
partisan restrictions imposed by Republican Party legislators to

give them an edge over the Democratic Party in the next elec-
tion, rather than racist restrictions to keep Black men and women 
down. But considering the ugly reality of American political his-
tory even in the later decades of the long twentieth century, this 
is not that surprising; this was a time, after all, when a Republi-
can Party standard-bearer (Ronald Reagan) referred to diplomats 
from Tanzania as “monkeys from those African countries,” and 
an economic policy standard-bearer (the University of Chicago’s 
George Stigler) damned Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil 
rights  leaders  for  their  “growing  insolence.”14  Plus  there  is  the 
question that Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices do 
not ask: If a political party goes all-in to attract bigots, is it then 
unbigoted to attempt to suppress the votes of those who are re-
pelled by that political strategy?

What  is  a  political  party  that  seeks  to  widen  and  reinforce 
hierarchies and differentials of wealth and income to do in a de-
mocracy?15 It needs to provide at least some potential majority 
with reasons to vote for it. Such a party can claim that it is supe-
rior at generating economic growth: that although it will give you 
a smaller piece of the economic pie, the pie will be bigger by more 
than enough to compensate. Sometimes this approach can lead 
to  good  governance,  particularly  in  the  context  of  a  two-party 
system  in  which  power  alternates  as  median  voters  swing  back 
and forth between the priorities of delivering faster growth and 
providing fairer distributions and less insecurity. But eventually, 
it requires more than just saying that the conservative policies will 
grow the economic pie faster—it requires actually delivering on 
that promise.

Failing that, the party can seek to make economic cleavages 
and inequalities of wealth less salient. That requires making other 
issues more salient: in other words, highlighting non-economic 
political cleavages and exploiting them. It can play the national-
ism card: the nation is in danger, under threat, and since defense

is more important than opulence, you cannot afford to vote for 
your lunch-pail interests. Or it can find some enemy not exter-
nal but internal, against whom a majority of the electorate can 
be rallied. And since the founding of the United States, political 
parties have found that the most effective way to deploy this strat-
egy has been to declare rhetorical (and often all-too-deadly real)  
war against its Black population. Note that it is not always the 
Republicans—it was, up until the 1940s, the Democrats. Back 
then, with respect to the American creed of equality of opportu-
nity, the Democrats had an edge on the equality part among white 
men, and the Republicans on the opportunity part. But a large 
part of making white men feel equal to each other was making 
them feel superior to Black men.16 And so a large chunk of the ap-
peal of the Democratic piece of America’s “Progressive” moment 
was its white supremacy.

The damage done during the Progressive Era by the rollback 
of freedoms for Black Americans has often been underestimated. 
Emancipation was followed by Reconstruction, which was then 
rolled back, and that political-economic-societal equilibrium was 
then further rolled back by Jim Crow, which devastated the then 
rising Black middle class.

As  of  1940,  the  average  Black  worker  in  the  United  States 
had  three  fewer  years  of  education  than  the  average  white 
worker. A substantial majority of white Americans approved of 
discrimination—  in  employment,  in  housing,  in  education,  and 
in voting. Black men were concentrated in unskilled agricultural 
labor, primarily in the low-productivity and low-income South; 
Black women were concentrated in unskilled agriculture and in 
domestic  service.  Both  were  extremely  low-paid  occupations: 
Black men and women earned an average weekly wage some 45 
percent that of their white counterparts. Black male college grad-
uates earned some $280 a week (in today’s dollars); white high 
school  graduates  earned  some  $560  a  week.  In  1940,  some  48

percent of white families fell below today’s “poverty line” accord-
ing to official statistics; meanwhile, some 81 percent of Black fam-
ilies were in poverty.

These disparities, along with a wide variety of other factors, 
converged to keep Black men and women subordinate. By the 
later decades of the long twentieth century much had changed. 
Virtually all whites publicly espoused the principle of equal em-
ployment opportunity for Black Americans. Educational attain-
ment by race was almost identical for those finishing school in 
the late 1980s and 1990s. Black men’s average weekly wages were 
two-thirds those of whites; Black women’s average weekly wages 
were  more  than  95  percent  those  of  white  women’s  wages,  on 
average.

It is impossible not to credit the change to the wise leadership 
and  skillful  use  of  moral  force  by  the  Black  community.  Civil 
rights leaders played a weak hand with immense skill and patience 
and achieved extraordinary long-run success. They are among the 
greatest of the heroes of the long twentieth century.

Three  factors  in  particular  played  a  major  role  in  bringing 
about the gains that were realized between 1940 and 1970: the 
end of formal, legal, state-sanctioned discrimination; the migra-
tion of Black Americans from the rural South to the urban North 
during  the  Second  Great  Migration;  and  the  associated  shift 
from  low-paid,  low-skill  agricultural  employment  to  industrial 
and service industries. The period was accompanied by large in-
creases in the educational levels attained by Black Americans and 
high  rates  of  employment  and  productivity  growth  in  the  rest 
of the economy. A fourth very significant factor came in 1964, 
when Title VII of the Civil Rights Act made employment dis-
crimination illegal. There is every reason to think that without it 
the economic advancement of Black Americans would have been 
considerably slower.

If the period from 1940 to 1970 was one of substantial rel-
ative  advance,  the  picture  after  1970  was  more  mixed.  By  the

end of the 1980s, at least one in five Black men between the ages 
of twenty-five and fifty-four in the United States were reporting 
no annual earnings at all. And even today, real per capita family 
income for Black Americans is still only some 60 percent of what 
it is for whites: almost exactly what it had been at the end of the 
1960s. The majority of white Americans believe there is no more 
personal racism—that white animus against Blacks was a thing 
in previous generations, but is no longer. And yet what keeps the 
relative incomes of Blacks so far down, except for racism? Much 
of this racism, indeed, is now recognized as “structural racism”: 
the frictions, institutions, and legacies of the past in their current 
shape of wealth and social network access, performing the func-
tions that personal racial animus used to perform.

Most important in stalling progress toward economic equality 
for Black people, in my judgment, was a general, economy-wide 
factor:  the  growth  in  income  inequality  as  employers’  relative 
demands  for  less-skilled  and  less-educated  workers  diminished. 
Also important were changes in family structure: a rise in divorce, 
a rise in births outside of marriage, and the consequent rise in 
single-parent households (almost inevitably female headed). By 
the later decades of the twentieth century, the poverty rate for 
two-parent Black families with children was 12.5 percent. The 
poverty  rate  for  single-parent  Black  families  with  children  was  
40 percent. And a full half of Black children spent at least half 
their childhood below the poverty line.

The right-wing explanation for the decline in the number of 
Black two-parent families—the explanation provided by the likes 
of Charles Murray17 and George Gilder18—was that more gen-
erous  welfare  payments  triggered  a  collapse  by  disincentivizing 
work  and  removing  the  material  economic  benefits  of  keeping 
adult couples together. The seminal work out of which Murray 
and Gilder and similar thinkers constructed their interpretation 
was  a  mid-1960s  document  written  by  a  Johnson  administra-
tion  policy  maker,  Daniel  Patrick  Moynihan.  But  Moynihan’s

The  Negro  Family:  The  Case  for  National  Action  was  shaped  in 
part by his own tendency to look inward rather than outward, by 
memories of his own Irish American family dynamics under ma-
terial pressure. It was more his own personal psychodrama than 
an analysis of the circumstances facing Black families. He did see 
powerful parallels between his own experience and what he imag-
ined to be the experience of Black children growing up in dire 
circumstances—parallels that he felt called for a national com-
mitment, so that in America’s future no child would have to grow 
up as he had, running with gangs in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan, 
or as he saw so many Black children growing up in the 1960s.19

Indeed, it is hard to escape the conclusion that Murray and 
Gilder simply had not done their arithmetic. Welfare and food 
stamp payments for a mother with three children rose by one-
third between 1960 and 1970, but then declined. By the mid-
1990s, welfare payments were lower in inflation-adjusted terms 
than  they  had  been  in  1960;  real  wages  were  some  one-third 
higher—some 50 percent higher for Black males. Maintaining a 
two-parent household was, in material terms, a much more ad-
vantageous option in the 1990s relative to splitting up and col-
lecting welfare than it had been in the 1950s and 1960s.

A better explanation was that Black families were caught in 
the backwash of broader, society-wide changes—but were espe-
cially vulnerable to them. The tide of inclusion may have carried 
with it a declining significance of race, but the post-1980 future 
was to bring with it a rising significance of class in the coming 
of a Second Gilded Age, and an explosion of income and wealth 
inequality even among white guys. To a degree, for Black Amer-
icans, the gains in social inclusion came not just too little but at 
least half a generation too late.

LET  US  RETURN,  FOR  a  moment,  to  the  immediate  post– 
World  War  II  period.  Again,  growth  was  faster  than  ever

before, unemployment was low, incomes were not too unequally 
distributed—at  least  if  you  were  a  white  guy  in  the  global 
north—and the boom-bust business cycle was very moderate. 
It was closer to material utopia for white guys than ever before, 
and rapidly getting closer still. But what about the women?

Plato’s Socrates, in the Republic, posited that there would be 
women among the ideal city’s Guardians, for the souls of men 
and women were fundamentally the same. Writing a generation 
after that, in 340 BCE or so, his pupil Aristotle begged to differ—
he thought there were significant differences:

Although there may be exceptions to the order of nature, the 
male is by nature fitter for command than the female, just 
as  the  elder  and  full-grown  is  superior  to  the  younger  and 
more immature. . . . The relation of the male to the female is 
of this kind, but there the inequality is permanent. . . . The 
slave has no deliberative faculty at all; the woman has, but it 
is  without  authority. . . . The  courage  and  justice  of  a  man 
and of a woman, are not, as Socrates maintained, the same; 
the courage of a man is shown in commanding, of a woman 
in obeying.20

We do need to look at the bigger picture. Why male suprem-
acy became so firmly established millennia ago, back in the Agrar-
ian Age, is not obvious. Yes, it was of the utmost importance to 
have surviving descendants, so that someone would be there to 
take care of you in your old age. Yes, in order to maximize their 
chances  of  having  surviving  descendants  to  take  care  of  them, 
it was important for men and women to have a lot of children. 
Thus the typical woman spent twenty years eating for two: preg-
nant and breastfeeding. And yes, eating for two is an enormous 
energy  drain,  especially  in  populations  near  subsistence  level 
(and Agrarian Age populations were near subsistence level). Yes, 
breastfeeding required women to remain physically close to their

children, and this helped enforce a concentration of female labor 
on activities that made it easy to do so: gardening and other forms 
of within-and-near-the-dwelling labor, especially textiles.

But, even given all that, men did derive tangible benefits from 
further oppressing women far above what one might argue were 
the limitations imposed by necessity in the form of mammalian 
biology under Malthusian conditions—especially if women could 
be convinced that they deserved it: “Unto the woman he said,  
‘I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow 
thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy hus-
band; and he shall rule over thee.’”

But for how long this high patriarchy has been a major piece 
of human culture is not something that we know. There are at 
least some signs in our genes of a big change about five thousand 
years ago: a sudden drop in humanity’s “effective” male popula-
tion—that is, the number of men living then who have descen-
dants  now.  There  was  no  such  drop  in  humanity’s  “effective” 
female population. About five thousand years ago, even as nearly 
all women who survived past menarche had children, a substan-
tial proportion of men who survived past puberty did not.21 How 
much societal pressure was required for it to become more or less 
the rule for women to share husbands, or to accept a much older 
one, and for a substantial proportion of men to remain unmar-
ried?  What  institutions  applied  this  pressure,  and  how?  About 
three thousand years ago the situation rebalanced: one-to-one in 
the household again became dominant. Was the origin of high 
patriarchy responsible for this rebalancing? Is this what we see 
in Aristotle’s statement that “the courage of a man is shown in 
commanding, of a woman in obeying”? (Do note that Aristotle 
maintains this conviction over strong disagreement from Socra-
tes—and Plato—for whom the souls of men and women were 
fundamentally the same.) Or was it present in human societies 
before?

If I were female, would I see the remarkable change in the 
position of women as central to history? Would I see the shift 
from  a  typical  experience  in  those  ancient  times—of  eight  or 
more pregnancies, twenty years of eating for two, and a one-in-
seven chance of dying in childbirth—to the modern experience 
of one or two pregnancies—along with a much reduced chance 
of dying in childbirth, depending on where you live—as one of 
the biggest changes? Is the rise of feminism the biggest news of 
the long twentieth century? Will historians a thousand or so years 
hence  see  it  as  more  consequential  than—although  interlinked 
with—the end of Malthusian poverty?

Let us jump back in time for a moment. In 1900, in the United 
States, paid male workers outnumbered paid female workers by 
a margin of about four to one. The imbalance was perhaps not 
quite  that  high—census  procedures  undercounted  the  number 
of women whose work products were in fact sold on the market, 
and  economists’  measures  have  traditionally  undervalued  with-
in-the-household  production.  Nevertheless,  the  difference  was 
striking. By the end of the century, however, the paid labor force 
was nearly half female.22

In 1900, the bulk of female workers in the census-counted, 
formally paid segment of the labor force were unmarried. Some 
43.5 percent of single women fifteen years old and up were in 
the  officially  counted  labor  force—41.5  percent  of  white  and 
60.5 percent of nonwhite women. By contrast, only 3.2 percent 
of married white women (and 26 percent of married nonwhite 
women,  for  a  national  average  of  5.6  percent)  participated  in 
the labor force. In 1920 only 4 percent of married white women 
around the age of thirty worked; by 1980 nearly 60 percent of 
married white women near thirty worked. Labor force participa-
tion by married nonwhite women near thirty rose less, but from a 
higher base and to a greater level: from approximately 33 percent 
in 1920 to 72 percent by 1980.

But this gives us an incomplete picture. Consider, for instance, 
the difference between women born around 1920 and those born 
around 1960. The earlier cohort reached adulthood around 1940 
and were sixty years old in 1980. The labor force participation 
rate  of  those  who  were  married  rose  from  roughly  15  percent 
when they were twenty to approximately 45 percent when they 
were fifty. Women born forty years later, around 1960, already 
had a 60 percent labor participation rate (among those who were 
married) when they were twenty—and every sign is that married 
women’s labor force participation rises with age.

However, the large increase in female labor force participa-
tion over the course of the twentieth century, while encouraging, 
was not accompanied by any rapid closing of the earnings gap be-
tween male and female workers. Although various sources report 
substantial rises in female-relative-to-male wages over the course 
of  the  nineteenth  century,  and  some  continued  gains  up  until 
1930, for most of the twentieth century female wages remained 
roughly 60 percent of male wages.

One reason female relative earnings failed to rise throughout 
the  middle  years  of  the  twentieth  century  is  the  rapidity  with 
which women expanded into the labor force. This rapid expansion 
in labor force participation meant that at any moment a relatively 
low share of the female labor force had a high level of experience. 
And because firms pay more for experienced workers—both be-
cause experienced workers are more productive, and because the 
promise of regular pay increases along a well-established career 
track can serve as a powerful way to motivate employees—that 
relative lack of experience kept women’s relative wages low.

A second factor keeping relative female earnings low was the 
persistence of occupational segregation by sex. Between 1900 and 
1960, roughly two-thirds of the female labor force would have 
had to change occupations in order to produce the same distri-
bution across occupations as the male labor force. Occupational 
segregation has fallen somewhat since the end of the 1960s, but it

is still the case that women are concentrated in occupations that 
are relatively low paid.

A third factor keeping women’s relative earnings low has been 
their inability to attain the qualifications that employers value. 
Women back at the start of the twentieth century had little op-
portunity for formal education. Nor did they have, for the most 
part, opportunities to gain economically valuable skills through 
informal  education  and  on-the-job  training.  By  and  large, 
women  were  employed  only  in  tasks  that  were  relatively  easily 
and quickly learned, and in which the benefits of experience on 
productivity were slim. The economist Claudia Goldin has esti-
mated that if we compensate for all three factors, we will see that 
the gap between what women and men with similar experience 
and education were paid at the start of the twenty-first century 
was relatively small.

Today the pay gap is less attributable to differences in wom-
en’s  and  men’s  experience,  education,  and  other  job-relevant 
characteristics than to what is apparently simply wage discrim-
ination: paying women less than men because they are women. 
Goldin traced the emergence of such wage discrimination to the 
development of the large modern firm, with its personnel depart-
ment. Before the development of the large, bureaucratic firm, the 
market provided substantial insulation against discrimination to 
women. With many small employers, should any one firm be-
gin to discriminate—to pay women less than men for the same 
work—women  would  have  the  opportunity  to  vote  with  their 
feet for some other, less discriminatory employer.

As  Goldin  wrote,  once  firms  had  established  personnel  de-
partments with centralized human resource policies, they discov-
ered that many women would not remain on the job long enough 
to take advantage of the regular wage increases that come with 
efficient, strong performance and loyalty to the firm. Then why 
reward the atypical woman who did remain on the job with those 
increases? This is not to say that all pay discrimination has been

in service of firms’ profit-maximizing. Naked prejudice certainly 
played a role—prejudice on the part of male workers, employers, 
and customers. Male workers, for example, fearing competition, 
tried to bar women from their occupations.

From today’s perspective, the most surprising thing about the 
transformation of the role of women in the economy is how long 
it took. This despite the fact that after World War II, the birth 
rate had fallen; a large clerical and retail sector, in which physi-
cal strength was completely irrelevant, had emerged; and female 
education had taken hold. Barriers to women’s employment per-
sisted, such as jobs that assumed workers must work full time; 
pervasive discrimination; social attitudes that deemed certain oc-
cupations inappropriate for women; and personnel policies that 
restricted or even prohibited the employment of married women.
In the long run, it took action on the part of the federal gov-
ernment  to  erode  the  framework  of  restrictions  and  customs 
that kept women’s economic roles from expanding. The action 
came in the form of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited 
discrimination  in  employment  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  reli-
gion, national origin, or sex. When the House Rules Committee 
chair during the debates over the bill, Howard Smith (D-VA), 
proposed  the  amendment  adding  “sex”  to  the  list  of  protected 
categories, he was at least half-joking, and it was not liberal Dem-
ocrats, but southern Democrats and Republicans, who approved 
it, 168–133. Courts decided that the “sex” part of the prohibition 
could not have been intended to stand on an equal footing with 
the others, and did not require that possible discrimination be 
scrutinized as strictly as in cases where race, color, or religion was 
at issue. Nevertheless, it was subject to more scrutiny than “here: 
we just thought up this reason.” Thus the legal environment mat-
tered.23 And so Claudia Goldin could conclude her book on the 
gender gap by pointing to the possibility of a future near-death of 
gender discrimination. Encouraged by “the convergence between 
men and women in the percentage graduating from college,” she

wrote that “we can forecast the future by observing the experi-
ences of young cohorts today, and these experiences give us ample 
ground for optimism.”24

But surely, even in the Agrarian Age, a shift to a society with 
less  male  supremacy  would  have  been  a  positive-sum  change. 
Women as equal participants in society, rather than just chat-
tels—classified  as  only  a  rung  above  slaves  and  cattle—could 
have done, and contributed, much more than they were able to 
do and contribute under the conditions of male supremacy that 
existed. Optimistic economists like me have a strong bias toward 
believing that people in groups will become more inclusive, will 
find ways to share, will become, collectively, more productive, 
and then will distribute the fruits of that productivity to make 
their social order more sustainable. Productivity depends on the 
division of labor. And if you invite more people into your tent, 
your division of labor can be finer and hence more productive. 
But apparently that is not how people saw it in the Agrarian Age 
or for many years thereafter.

The underpinnings of male supremacy did begin to erode be-
fore 1870. But it was over the long twentieth century that these 
underpinnings dissolved more completely. Reductions in infant 
mortality, the advancing average age of marriage, and the increas-
ing costs of child-rearing all contributed to a decrease in fertility. 
The number of years the typical woman spent eating for two fell 
from twenty down to four as better sanitation, much better nu-
trition, and more knowledge about disease made many pregnan-
cies less necessary for leaving surviving descendants, and as birth 
control technology made it easier to plan families. And, after ex-
ploding in the Industrial Age, the rate of population growth in 
the industrial core slowed drastically. The population explosion 
turned out to be a relatively short-run thing. Humanity appears 
to be rapidly moving toward zero long-run population growth.

The path of within-the-household technological advance also 
worked to the benefit of the typical woman over the course of

the long twentieth century: dishwashers, dryers, vacuum cleaners, 
improved chemical cleansing products, other electrical and natu-
ral gas appliances, and especially clothes-washing machines—all 
these made the tasks of keeping the household clean, ordered, and 
functioning much easier. Maintaining a high-fertility household 
in the nineteenth century was much more than a full-time job. 
Doing so in the late twentieth century could become more like 
a part-time job. Thus a great deal of female labor that had pre-
viously been tied to full-time work within the household could 
now be redirected to other purposes. And, as Betty Friedan wrote 
in the early 1960s, women who sought something like equal sta-
tus could find it only if they found “identity . . . in work . . . for 
which, usually, our society pays.”25 As long as women were con-
fined to separate, domestic occupations that the market did not 
reward with cash, it was easy for men to denigrate and minimize 
their labor.

While it is undeniably true that the explosion of wealth be-
gun in 1870 was a multiplier of this century’s brutal and barbaric 
tyrannies, two more enduring tyrannies—racism and sexism—
gave ground, slowly, reluctantly, and partially. On the one hand, 
this progress, even if its speed was deliberate, raised the bar as to 
how fast humanity should be slouching toward utopia, and how 
much of a slowdown in progress would generate strong calls for 
change. On the other hand, status in society is, if not zero-sum, 
close to zero-sum. How were those whose gender, ethnicity, and 
caste  privileges  were  being  eroded  by  the  tide  of  inclusion  to 
reconcile themselves with what was dérogeance ? The answer, for 
the first post–World War II generation in the global north, was 
through unprecedented rapid income growth, opportunity, and 
upward mobility.

Thirty Glorious Years  
of Social Democracy

H istory does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme—oddly. As 

of 1870, the then 1.3 billion people on earth had an aver-
age income of about $1,300 of today’s dollars per year. By 1938 
the population had perhaps doubled from 1870, and the aver-
age  income  had  grown  a  bit  more  than  2.5-fold.  Things  were 
much better. Before 1870, things had been rocky for the world. 
Remember John Stuart Mill’s pessimism, let alone Karl Marx’s, 
about how few of the potential gains from technological advance 
had been trickling down? Before 1938, things had been rocky for 
the world in World War I and then again in the Great Depres-
sion, and they were about to get rockier still. The world was about 
to fall into the immense destruction of World War II, along with 
its more than 50 million deaths, a devastating interruption of the 
slouching progress upward. Yet 1870–1914 also brought with it 
an extraordinary era of prosperity, a never-before-seen economic 
El  Dorado,  and  1938–1973—for  the  World  War  II  mobiliza-
tion brought a powerful spurt of growth to those countries lucky 
enough not to be battlefields, most notably the United States—
was to bring with it another such glorious age.

Thus from 1938 to 1973 the world economy leaped ahead 
once again—and once again at an unprecedented pace. And the 
core of the global north, the countries we now call the G-7 (the 
United  States,  Canada,  Japan,  Britain,  France,  Germany,  and  
Italy) raced forward: not at the 0.7 percent per year pace of 1913–
1938,  or  even  the  1.42  percent  per  year  pace  of  1870–1913, 
but—in spite of all the destruction wrought by World War II—
at an average pace of 3 percent per year. That means the material 
wealth of those countries was increasing fast enough to double 
every twenty-three years—in the space of less than a generation. 
The  G-7  was  thus  three  times  as  well-off  in  material  terms  by 
1973 as it had been in 1938.

The poorest of them, Japan, grew the fastest: at a previously 
unseen  rate  of  4.7  percent  per  year—in  spite  of  the  extensive 
damage it sustained during the war, including the atomic bombs 
that incinerated two Japanese cities in 1945. Canada and Italy 
grew at rates of more than 3 percent per year. And the G-7 coun-
tries were not alone: Mexico, Spain, and many others achieved 
similar rates of growth.

The  French  call  this  period  the  Thirty  Glorious  Years:  the 
Trente Glorieuses.1 So much good luck in one package was unex-
pected. It is still to marvel at—if you are a political economist.

If you are a neoclassical economist, however, you shrug your 
shoulders. The market economy delivered, as it should, full em-
ployment, proper infrastructure, and protection of contracts and 
private property. Modern science delivered, too, in the form of 
a  host  of  fundamental  technological  breakthroughs.  Moreover, 
there was a large backlog of previous discoveries that had been 
left undeveloped and undeployed during the chaos of the Great 
Depression. So it was profitable for businesses to provide their 
industrial research labs with generous funding and then to deploy 
the labs’ new innovations at scale. In doing so, companies were 
able to build their knowledge and pull previously untrained and 
unskilled workers from farms and craft workshops into “Fordist”

assembly lines.2 This was, for us neoclassical economists, the nor-
mal and natural way things work, or should work, in the Modern 
Economic Growth Age. Never mind that for economic progress 
to follow this natural course was, in the long twentieth century, 
unusual, to say the least.

It was, come to full life and power, Friedrich von Hayek’s 
positive vision of the power of the market. The market giveth, 
and giveth, and giveth yet more. There were those who ques-
tioned  Hayek’s  conclusions.  The  economist  Herbert  Simon 
liked to point out that what Hayek called a “market economy” 
was not a field of green market exchanges, in which were scat-
tered red dots of small individual firms, but instead red areas 
of firm command-and-control organization connected by green 
lines of market exchange. Harvard economist Martin Weitzman 
liked to point out that there was no deep theoretical reason why 
providing  the  information  that  firms  needed  via  a  price  tar-
get—produce if you can make it for a fully amortized unit cost 
of less than $X—should be more efficient than via a quantity 
target— produce Y units.3 But Hayek’s colleague Ronald Coase, 
at the University of Chicago, pointed out that one of the mar-
ket economy’s great strengths was that it allowed firms to de-
cide whether to use a bureaucratic command-and-control-style 
system or a system based on transactions costs (of buying and 
selling) to make decisions: the fact that firms could choose was 
key.4 Plus the fact that firms were always subject to the disci-
pline of the marketplace, with those that lost money shrinking 
and  vanishing  in  a  way  that  state-run  bureaucracies  that  lost 
money did not.5

But before Friedrich von Hayek’s word could become flesh, 
and dwell among us, there were three prerequisites. First, Hayek 
had  to  be  divorced  from  theories  and  philosophies  such  as 
those of the novelist Ayn Rand. A functional market required 
competition— not monopolies bossed by technological and orga-
nizational visionaries.6

Second, Hayek had to be married to the ideas of John May-
nard Keynes. The market economy could only work properly—
could only direct resources to their “best” uses—if the spending 
was there to make enterprise profitable.

John Maynard Keynes had written in 1936, with more than 
a hint of sarcasm, that his proposals for the “enlargement of the 
functions of government” that were required in order to adjust 
“the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest” might 
seem  “a  terrific  encroachment”  on  freedom  “to  a  nineteenth- 
century publicist or . . . contemporary American financier.” But, 
in  fact,  they  were  “the  condition  of  the  successful  functioning 
of individual initiative.” And “if effective demand is deficient,” 
he added, a businessperson was “operating with the odds loaded 
against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with 
many zeros, so that the players as a whole will lose.” Only “excep-
tional skill or unusual good fortune” would then allow entrepre-
neurship and enterprise to be rewarded, and economic growth to 
continue. But with Keynes’s policies in place, “effective demand 
[would be] adequate, [and] average skill and average good fortune 
will be enough.” In the Thirty Glorious Years, wise business lead-
ers recognized that Keynes and his full-employment policies were 
not their enemies but their best friends.7

Third, Friedrich von Hayek had to be married to Karl Pol-
anyi.  One  of  the  foundation  stones  of  Hayek’s  worldview  was 
that the market economy was the only way to generate growth 
and  prosperity,  but  that  it  could  never,  and  should  never,  be 
asked to produce fairness and social justice. Fairness and social 
justice required distributing good things to people who had acted 
well, and deserved them. The market economy distributed things 
to people lucky enough to control resources that produced things 
for which the rich had a serious jones.

In  Polanyi’s  worldview,  people  and  communities  believed 
extremely  strongly  that  they  had  the  right  to  demand  certain 
things—among them stable land-use patterns that they deemed 

398

fair, income levels commensurate with their effort and merit, and 
the ability to keep their jobs, or at least find new ones without 
too much trouble. But the market economy would deliver those 
essentials only if they passed a maximum-profitability test. Some 
violations  of  Polanyian  rights  could  be  overlooked  if  economic 
growth was fast enough: I am not getting the slice of the pie I 
deserve, but at least I am getting a bigger slice than my mother 
and father got. The fiscal dividend the government received from 
growing tax revenues could, in a time of rapid economic growth, 
allow the government to do something to protect and vindicate 
Polanyian rights as well. A social democratic government needed 
to enable the market economy in order to generate growth and 
prosperity. But it also needed to check the market, and keep the 
“market economy” from turning into a “market society” that peo-
ple might reject, a society where employment was not stable, in-
comes were not commensurate with what people deserved, and 
communities  were  being  continually  upended  and  transformed 
by market fluctuations.

It was a balancing act. In some sense, the balancing act was 
made more complex by the swiftness of the tide toward greater 
inclusion. On the one hand, the tide extended not just to gender, 
race, and ethnicity but also to class: it no longer made as much 
sense to working-class males that they were in their subordinate 
place for a good reason. On the other hand, they found themselves 
losing some part of the deference from others that they had taken 
as their due, and that had softened the perceived slope of the class 
pyramid. Both of these factors magnified the chances that they 
would see violations of this expected order—of what they saw as 
what they deserved—large enough to become calls for action.

But rapid growth in incomes and perceived opportunities for 
yourself and your children made up for much of the disruption 
of whatever old-order patterns supported you in what you saw as 
your proper place in society, the place you thought you deserved. 
So  the  global  north  was  able  to  keep  the  balance  through  the

1960s and into the 1970s. And by 1975, the deployed techno-
logical capability of humanity stood at nine times what it had 
been in 1870. The population explosion meant that there were 
then 4 billion people, compared to 1.3 billion in 1870. But that 
population explosion, and the pressure it placed on the resource 
base,  merely  meant  that  material  productivity  was  only  five 
times what it had been in 1870—and as of 1975 it was astonish-
ingly unequally distributed across countries, and also unequally  
(although less so, markedly, than it had been over 1870–1930) 
distributed within countries.

Things had worked. The Great Depression, in the United 
States at least, had convinced many that these divorces and mar-
riages had to happen. The Gilded Age oligarchy of the robber 
barons had failed, and had in fact brought on the Great Depres-
sion—how was not quite clear, but, as Franklin Roosevelt put it, 
there was near-consensus that the oligarchs and the plutocratic 
financiers needed to be cast down “from their high seats in the 
temple of our civilization.”8 Competition needed to rule. The 
Great Depression had also convinced the private sector that it 
needed the help of an active government to manage the econ-
omy in order to attain at least an approximation of full employ-
ment. Perhaps, more importantly, the Depression convinced the 
middle class that it had powerful interests in common with the 
working class—and from then on, both would demand social 
insurance and full employment from politicians. Adding to all 
of this, the totalitarian threat from Stalin’s Soviet Union played 
a  large  role  in  convincing  the  nascent  North  Atlantic  alliance 
to follow America’s lead in both security policy and political- 
economic restructuring. And those were topics on which Amer-
ica had strong ideas.

Between the two world wars, the governments of rich coun-
tries had been badly hobbled by their doctrines of orthodoxy and 
austerity,  by  their  insistence  on  pure  laissez-faire,  that  the  gov-
ernment should simply leave the economy alone. That doctrine

had started out as a weapon to dismantle aristocratic mercantilism  
and then turned into a weapon to fight progressive taxes, social 
insurance programs, and “socialism” more generally.

We can mark the sea-change in ideas that enabled these by 
looking  at  American  right-wing  economist  Milton  Friedman, 
who saw himself as—and sold himself as—the apostle of laissez- 
faire. Right-wingers trying to hold tight to their belief that the 
market  could  not  fail,  but  could  only  be  failed,  claimed  that  
the Great Depression had been caused by government interfer-
ence with the natural order. Economists such as Lionel Robbins, 
Joseph Schumpeter, and Friedrich von Hayek claimed that cen-
tral banks had set interest rates too low in the run-up to 1929. 
Others claimed that central banks had set interest rates too high. 
Whatever. What they agreed on was that the central banks of the 
world had failed to follow a properly “neutral” monetary policy, 
and  so  had  destabilized  what,  if  left  alone,  would  have  been  a 
stable market system. Milton Friedman was chief among them.

But dig into Friedman’s thesis that the Great Depression was 
a failure of government and not of market, and things become in-
teresting. For how could you tell whether interest rates were too 
high, too low, or just right? According to Friedman, too-high in-
terest rates would lead to high unemployment. Too-low interest 
rates would lead to high inflation. Just-right interest rates—those 
that corresponded to a “neutral” monetary policy—would keep 
the macroeconomy balanced and the economy smoothly grow-
ing. Thus theory became tautology.9

It is an insult to the ghost of the astronomer Claudius Ptol-
emy, who developed some brilliant insights, to call this exercise 
Ptolemaic: that is to say, saving the phenomenon by redefining 
terms and adding complications, rather than admitting that you 
are looking at things upside down to preserve your intellectual 
commitments.  But  this,  from  Friedman,  was  positively  Ptole-
maic. Strip away the camouflage and the underlying message is 
Keynes’s: the government needs to intervene on as large a scale as

needed in order to shape the flow of economy-wide spending and 
keep it stable, and, in doing so successfully, guard the economy 
against  depressions  while  preserving  the  benefits  of  the  market 
system, along with human economic liberty and political and in-
tellectual freedom.

The only substantive difference between Keynes and Fried-
man was that Friedman thought that central banks could do all 
this alone, via monetary policy, by keeping interest rates properly 
“neutral.” Keynes thought more would be required: the govern-
ment would probably need its own spending and taxing incen-
tives to encourage businesses to invest and households to save. 
But the incentives alone would not be enough: “I conceive,” he 
wrote, “that a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of invest-
ment  will  prove  the  only  means  of  securing  an  approximation 
to  full  employment,  though  this  need  not  exclude  all  manner 
of  compromises  and  of  devices  by  which  public  authority  will 
co-operate with private initiative.”10

And a large majority of people agreed with him. The magni-
tude of unemployment during the Great Depression had shifted 
politicians’, industrialists’, and bankers’ beliefs about the key goals 
of economic policy. Before the Depression, a stable currency and 
exchange rate were key. But afterward, even the bankers recog-
nized that a high overall level of employment was more important 
than  avoiding  inflation:  universal  bankruptcy  and  mass  unem-
ployment were not only bad for workers but bad for capitalists 
and bankers.

Thus,  entrepreneurs,  the  owners  and  managers  of  indus-
try,  and  even  the  bankers  found  that  they  gained,  not  lost,  by 
committing  to  maintain  high  employment.  High  employment 
meant  high-capacity  utilization.  Rather  than  seeing  tight  labor 
markets erode proﬁts by raising wages, owners saw high demand 
spread ﬁxed costs out over more commodities, and so increase 
proﬁtability.

Thirty Glorious Years of Social Democracy 

In  the  United  States,  the  consolidation  of  the  mixed-econ-
omy Keynesian social democratic order was straightforward. The 
United States had always been committed to a market economy. 
Yet it had also always been committed to a functional and prag-
matic government. It had had a Progressive movement that had 
set out plans for the management of the market economy in the 
interests of equitable growth at the start of the 1900s. And it was 
the beneficiary of the fortunate accident that the right-wing party 
had been in power up until 1932, and hence took the lion’s share 
of the blame for the Depression. All of this together made its path 
relatively smooth. Roosevelt picked up the reins, and in 1945, 
when he died, Truman picked them up again. The electorate rat-
ified the New Deal order by giving Truman his own full term 
in 1948. And in 1953, the new Republican president, Dwight  
Eisenhower, saw his task not as rolling back his Democratic pre-
decessors’ programs, but rather as containing the further expan-
sion of what he muttered under his breath was “collectivism.”

The 1946 Employment Act declared that it was the “continu-
ing policy and responsibility” of the federal government to “co-
ordinate and utilize all its plans, functions, and resources . . . to 
foster  and  promote  free  competitive  enterprise  and  the  general 
welfare; conditions under which there will be afforded useful em-
ployment  for  those  able,  willing,  and  seeking  to  work;  and  to 
promote  maximum  employment,  production,  and  purchasing 
power.”11 Laws that establish goals can and do serve as markers of 
changes in opinions, perceptions, and aims. The largest shift in 
policy marked by the Employment Act was the post–World War 
II practice of allowing the government’s fiscal automatic stabiliz-
ers to function.

We have already noted Eisenhower’s letter to his brother Ed-
gar in the 1950s, in which he argued that laissez-faire was dead, 
and that attempts to resurrect it were simply “stupid.” Milton 
Friedman and Eisenhower saw the same escape hatch that John

Maynard Keynes had seen, and were just as eager to open and 
crawl through it. Indeed, the government programs that Eisen-
hower pointed to in his letter and their analogues in other ad-
vanced industrial countries have been remarkably successful in 
uniting political coalitions. As Eisenhower put it, “Should any 
political  party  attempt  to  abolish  social  security,  unemploy-
ment  insurance,  and  eliminate  labor  laws  and  farm  programs, 
you  would  not  hear  of  that  party  again  in  our  political  histo-
ry.”12 Voters, in other words, distrusted politicians who sought 
to cut these programs back, and tended to find taxes earmarked 
to support social insurance programs less distasteful than other 
taxes. Outside of the United States, right-of-center parties have 
seldom made any serious attempt to take a stand against social 
democracy.

Eisenhower’s  vision  was  a  consensus,  not  in  the  sense  that 
overwhelming majorities agreed with it in their hearts-of-hearts, 
but  in  the  sense  that  overwhelming  majorities  believed  that  it 
would be impolitic to call for a return to Calvin Coolidge’s or 
Herbert Hoover’ s America.

The  result  was  big  government  and  then  some.  Federal 
spending  under  Eisenhower  was  18  percent  of  GDP—twice 
what  it  had  been  in  peacetime  even  at  the  height  of  the  New 
Deal. And state and local government spending raised total gov-
ernment spending to over 30 percent. In pre–New Deal 1931, 
federal spending had been just 3.5 percent of GDP, and a full 
half of all federal employees were in the Post Office. By 1962, the 
federal government directly employed some 5,354,000 workers. 
And that was in a nation of some 180 million people. In 2010, 
that number was down to 4,443,000—with a population of over 
300 million. This very large flow of government cash immune to 
the vagaries of the business cycle enabled vigorous and profitable 
private initiative. And high taxes, not high borrowings, paid for 
big government: federal deficits averaged less than 1 percent of 
GDP from 1950 to 1970.

Although there was no major reshuffling of class and wealth, 
median  incomes  steadily  rose,  creating  a  strong  middle  class. 
Cars, houses, appliances, and good schools had previously been 
reserved for the top 10 percent—by 1970, they became the prop-
erty of, or at least within the grasp of, the majority.

Federal government efforts to promote home building and 
home  ownership  by  making  mortgage  financing  more  flexible 
actually  began  under  Herbert  Hoover,  who  in  August  1932 
signed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to provide government 
credit for mortgages on houses. It set out what was to become 
the United States’ approach to government promotion and assis-
tance for housing. Instead of directly providing housing (which 
became the norm in Europe), the government would offer sub-
stantial  support  for  the  financing  of  the  private  development 
and  ownership  of  houses.  The  Home  Owners’  Loan  Corpo-
ration,  created  around  the  same  time,  financed  over  1  million 
mortgages  between  August  1933  and  August  1935,  and  set  in 
place what would become the enduring mechanisms of US mort-
gage financing: long terms, fixed rates, low down payments, and  
amortization—backstopped by a government guarantee, which 
was necessary to persuade banks that it was good business to lend 
at a fixed rate for thirty years to borrowers who always had the 
option to pay off their loan at any instant.

Single-family houses on lots of even one-fifth or one-tenth 
of  an  acre  meant  automobiles.  At  scale,  the  older  model,  of 
suburbs connected to urban centers by streetcars or commuter 
trains, would not work. What took their place were the stupen-
dous,  omnipresent  circulatory  systems  of  limited  access  high-
ways.  The  National  Defense  Highway  Act  of  1956  called  for 
41,000 miles of high-speed highways with the federal govern-
ment paying 90 percent of the costs. Transportation money was 
even more sharply skewed to the suburbs (and away from the 
needs  of  the  cities)  than  Federal  Housing  Administration  in-
surance: only about 1 percent of federal transportation funding

went to mass transit. And two-thirds of the highway lane-miles 
were built within the boundaries of metropolitan areas: the In-
terstate Highway System should have been named the Subur-
ban Highway System.

Indeed, the migration to the suburbs brought with it a new 
kind of built-in democratization, a homogenization of consump-
tion patterns. All but the lower ranks—and the Blacker ranks—
of  American  families  found  their  place  and  felt  it  to  be  much 
the same place: middle-class America. They repeatedly told this 
to  survey  takers.  Social  scientists  had  difficulty  understanding 
how and why three-fourths of Americans persisted in saying that 
they were middle class. White middle-class Americans did not: 
they happily marched, or rather drove, out to take possession of 
their  new  suburban  homes.  Suburban  development  was  an  ex-
treme form of segregation by class and, of course, by race. But the 
divide was not all-important. There was still just one nation— 
middle-class America—even as some got more than others.

In 1944, with the end of the war in sight, the government 
was worried about how 16 million GIs returning home would 
find jobs. It passed the GI bill providing, in place of a traditional 
veterans’ bonus, a generous program of support for GIs wishing 
to go to college—it would keep them out of the labor force for 
a little while—plus a major mortgage assistance program for re-
turning soldiers, with the valuable extra kicker of possibly zero 
down payment.

The  post–Great  Depression,  postwar  consensus  that  was 
forming in the United States included a place for labor unions, 
too: they would be an essential part of the marriage of Hayek and 
Polanyi. In 1919, union membership in the United States had 
amounted to some 5 million. Membership fell into a trough of 
perhaps 3 million by the time of FDR’s inauguration in 1933, 
grew to 9 million by the end of 1941, and took advantage of the 
tight labor market of World War II to grow to some 17 million 
or so by the time Eisenhower was inaugurated in 1953.

From 1933 to 1937, organizing unions became easier—in 
spite of high unemployment—because of the solid swing of the 
political system in favor of the increasingly liberal Democrats. 
The federal government was no longer an anti-, but a pro-union 
force.  The  Wagner  Act  gave  workers  the  right  to  engage  in  
collective bargaining. A National Labor Relations Board mon-
itored  and  greatly  limited  the  ability  of  anti-union  employers 
to  punish  union  organizers  and  members.  Employers  in  large 
mass- production industries learned to value the mediation be-
tween  bosses  and  employees  that  unions  could  provide.  And 
workers  learned  to  value  the  above-market  wages  that  unions 
could negotiate.

Along  with  the  1930s  rise  and  institutional  entrenchment 
of  the  union  movement,  there  came  the  great  compression  of 
America’s wages and salaries. In the late 1920s and 1930s, the 
top 10 percent, the top 1 percent, and the top 0.01 percent of 
the US population held 45 percent, 20 percent, and 3 percent of 
the nation’s wealth, respectively. By the 1950s, those shares were 
down to about 35 percent, 12 percent, and 1 percent. (By 2010 
they would be back up, rising to 50 percent, 20 percent, and 5 
percent.)13 To some degree, this was because education had won 
its race with technology, temporarily making usually poorly paid 
“unskilled” workers relatively scarce—and hence valued. To some 
degree, too, it was because closing down immigration had similar 
effects on the supply of workers with shaky (or no) English. But 
that this “great compression” is found all across the North Atlan-
tic economies suggests that the political-economic factors played 
a greater role than the supply-and-demand factors. Unions also 
contributed to compressing the wage distribution. And minimum 
wage laws and other regulations played a role, too. Finally, there 
was the strongly progressive tax system instituted to fight World 
War II—which disincentivized the wealthy from trying too hard 
to enrich themselves at the expense of others. If a CEO rewarding 
himself with a much larger share of the company’s total profits

incited the ire of the union, it might not have been worthwhile 
for him to try.

Walter Reuther was born in 1907 in Wheeling, West Vir-
ginia, to German immigrant socialist parents.14 His father took 
him to visit imprisoned socialist-pacifist Eugene V. Debs during 
World War I. And he learned “the philosophy of trade union-
ism,” and heard about “the struggles, hopes, and aspirations of 
working  people,”  every  day  he  spent  in  his  parents’  house.  At 
the age of nineteen he left Wheeling to become a mechanic at 
the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, making the tools that the 
assembly-line  workers  would  use.  In  1932  he  was  fired  from 
Ford  for  organizing  a  rally  for  Norman  Thomas,  the  Socialist 
Party candidate for president. He spent 1932 through 1935 trav-
eling the world. During this time, he trained Russian workers 
in Gorky—Nizhny Novgorod—to work the Model T produc-
tion-line  machines  that  Ford  had  sold  to  Stalin,  when  he  re-
placed the Model T with the Model A in 1927. Back in Detroit, 
he joined the United Auto Workers (UAW), and in December 
1936 he launched a sit-down strike against Ford’s brake supplier, 
Kelsey-Hayes.  Thousands  of  sympathizers  came  out  to  block 
management’s attempts to move the machines elsewhere so they 
could restart production with scabs.

Democrat Frank Murphy had just narrowly defeated incum-
bent Republican Frank Fitzgerald for the post of Michigan gover-
nor. In an earlier decade, the police—or, as in the Pullman strike 
forty years earlier, the army—would have shown up to enforce 
the owners’ and managers’ property rights. Not in 1936. After ten 
days, under very strong pressure from Ford, which needed those 
brakes,  Kelsey-Hayes  gave  in.  Membership  in  Reuther’s  UAW 
Local 174 grew from 200 at the start of December 1936 to 35,000 
by the end of 1937. In 1937 Reuther and his brothers launched 
a sit-down strike against General Motors, then the largest corpo-
ration in the world, in its production center of Flint, Michigan.

The striking workers gained control of the only plant that made 
engines  for  GM’s  best-selling  brand,  Chevrolet.  This  time,  the 
new governor, Murphy, did send in the police, but not to evict  
the strikers; rather, they were told to “keep the peace.”

By 1946 Reuther was head of the UAW, following a strategy 
of using the union’s power not just to win higher wages and better 
working conditions for its members, but to “fight for the welfare 
of the public at large . . . as an instrument of social change.” The 
UAW was one; the auto companies were many—the big three, 
GM, Ford, and Chrysler, and a number of smaller producers that 
shrank over time. Reuther’s tactic was, each year, to threaten to 
strike one of the three, and then to carry through on the threat: 
the struck company would lose money while it was shut down, 
and  UAW  members  working  for  other  companies  would  sup-
port the strikers, but the other companies would neither lock out 
workers nor support their struck competitor with cash. After four 
post–World War II years of annual strike threats, in 1950 GM 
CEO Charlie Wilson proposed a five-year no-strike contract. Re-
uther negotiated not just higher wages but also company-financed 
health care and retirement programs plus cost-of-living increases. 
This was the “Treaty of Detroit.” It meant that autoworkers now 
had not just a fair income but also the stability to think about 
buying a detached house, moving to the suburbs, and commuting 
in the cars they built: the upper levels of the working class were 
now middle class.

In 1970, Reuther, along with his wife, May, and four others, 
were killed when the plane they were in crashed in the fog on 
final approach to the Pellston Regional Airport in Michigan. The 
plane’s altimeter had both missing parts and incorrect parts, some 
of which had been installed upside down. Reuther had previously 
survived at least two assassination attempts.

The third component of the postwar Keynesian consensus in 
the United States was the welfare, or social insurance, state. But

the United States’ social insurance state turned out to be signifi-
cantly less generous than the typical European iteration. From a 
Western European perspective, the US version was anemic. Even 
the conservative Margaret Thatcher in Britain found the absence 
of  state-sponsored  medical  care  in  the  United  States  appalling, 
and even barbarous. And across the board, means-tested social in-
surance programs in the United States did less to level the playing 
field than similar European programs did. US efforts to give the 
poor additional purchasing power in the first post–World War II 
generation included initiatives such as food stamps to subsidize 
diet, Aid to Families with Dependent Children to provide single 
mothers  with  some  cash,  and  a  small  and  rationed  amount  of 
low-quality public housing.

At  the  same  time,  social  democracy  in  a  broader  sense  in 
the  United  States  encompassed  a  vast  array  of  initiatives  and 
organizations, which included, among many others, the Inter-
state Highway System, airport construction, air traffic control, 
the US Coast Guard, the National Park Service, and govern-
ment support for research and development through agencies 
such  as  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology, 
the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  and 
the National Institutes of Health. It also included the antitrust 
lawyers  of  the  Department  of  Justice  and  the  Federal  Trade 
Commission,  the  financial  regulators  in  the  Securities  and 
Exchange  Commission,  the  Office  of  the  Comptroller  of  the 
Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the Pension Benefit Guar-
antee  Corporation.  And  it  included  a  promise  by  the  federal 
government to insure small bank depositors against bank fail-
ures, and big bankers—systemically important financial institu-
tions—against collapse, as well as Social Security and all of its 
cousins—Supplemental Security Income, Head Start, and the 
Earned Income Tax Credit. None of these programs would be 
seen as a proper use of the government by even the weakest-tea 
sympathizer with libertarianism.

That the Great Depression was a major impetus for Ameri-
ca’s leftward shift from a laissez-faire system to a more managed, 
“mixed” economy had an impact on the form of the post–World 
War II welfare state. In Europe, the mixed economy had a some-
what egalitarian bent: it was to level the income distribution and 
insure citizens against the market. In the United States, the major 
welfare state programs were sold as “insurance” in which individ-
uals, on average, got what they paid for. They were not tools to 
shift the distribution of income. Social Security made payments 
proportional to earlier contributions. The pro-labor Wagner Act 
framework  was  of  most  use  to  relatively  skilled  and  well-paid 
workers with secure job attachments who could use the legal ma-
chinery  to  share  in  their  industries’  proﬁts.  And  the  degree  of 
progressiveness in the income tax was always limited.

The goals of social democracy were notably different from the 
high socialist goal of making it the state’s responsibility to provide 
necessities such as food and shelter as entitlements of citizenship, 
or comradeship, rather than things that had to be earned by the 
sweat of one’s brow. Social democracy instead focused on provid-
ing income supports and progressive taxes to redistribute income 
in a more egalitarian direction. Whereas high socialism’s system 
of public provision could often be inefficient, a system that sim-
ply distributed income in a more egalitarian way avoided waste by 
providing only for those in need, and by harnessing the magical 
efficiencies of the market to societal goals.

In  something  like  a  shotgun  marriage,  Hayek  and  Polanyi 
awkwardly kept house under social democracy for decades—as 
long as the country was blessed with Keynes’s full employment— 
more  inclusively  than  before,  and  with  sufficient,  if  wary, 
cordiality.

IT WAS NOT A given that Western Europe would become more 
social democratic than the United States in the post–World War

II period. Its internal politics had by and large swung to the right 
during the Great Depression. And its commitments to both po-
litical democracy and market institutions had been weaker than 
such  commitments  in  the  United  States  for  generations.  Yet 
somehow, in total, Western Europe’s social safety net and welfare 
state policies drastically exceeded those of the United States.

And as we have observed in previous chapters, Western Eu-
rope’s  commitment  to  social  democracy  paid  off:  the  Western 
European  economies  boomed  in  the  1950s  and  1960s.  What 
post–World War II Europe accomplished in six years had taken 
post–World War I Europe sixteen. The growth rate of the West-
ern European GDP, which had been hovering between 2 and 2.5 
percent per year since the beginning of the long twentieth cen-
tury, accelerated to an astonishing 4.8 percent per year between 
1953 and 1973. The boom carried total production per capita 
to  unprecedented  levels—and  in  both  France  and  West  Ger-
many, labor productivity had outstripped their pre-1913 trends 
by 1955.15

Part of what drove Europe’s rapid growth was its exception-
ally high rate of investment, nearly twice as high as it had been in 
the last decade before World War I.

Another  part  of  what  drove  the  growth  was  the  European 
labor market, which achieved a remarkable combination of full 
employment and very little upward pressure on wages in excess of 
productivity gains.

As economic historian Charles Kindleberger explained, this 
stability  in  the  labor  market  was  caused  by  elastic  supplies  of 
underemployed  labor  from  rural  sectors  within  the  advanced 
countries and from Europe’s southern and eastern fringe. Elastic 
supplies of labor disciplined labor unions, which otherwise might 
have pushed aggressively for untenable wages. But the situation 
was surely also a result of the shadow cast by recent history. Mem-
ory of high unemployment and strife between the wars served to 
moderate labor-market conflict. Conservatives remembered that

attempts to roll back interwar welfare states had led to polariza-
tion and a lack of stability—and had ultimately set the stage for 
fascism. Left-wingers, meanwhile, could recall the other side of 
the same story. Both could reflect on the stagnation of the inter-
war period and blame it on political deadlock. For all, the bet-
ter strategy seemed to be to push for productivity improvements 
first and defer redistributions later.16

As  the  first  post–World  War  II  generation  turned  into  the 
second, and as industries in the industrial core became more and 
more mechanized, they should have become more and more vul-
nerable to foreign competition from other, lower-wage countries. 
If  Henry  Ford  could  redesign  production  so  that  unskilled  as-
sembly-line workers did what skilled craftsmen used to do, what 
was stopping Ford—or anyone else, for that matter—from rede-
signing production so that it could be carried out by low-wage 
workers from outside the North Atlantic region?

Industries did indeed begin to migrate from the rich indus-
trial core to the poor periphery. But in the first post–World War 
II generation or two, they did so slowly. One reason was added 
risk of political instability: investors tend to be wary of commit-
ting their money in places where it is easy to imagine significant 
political disruptions. Moreover, there were substantial advantages 
for a ﬁrm in keeping production in the industrial core, near other 
machines and other factories making similar products. Doing so 
meant both access to a reliable electric power grid and proximity 
to  the  specialists  needed  to  ﬁx  the  many  things  that  could  go 
wrong with complex machinery.

These  factors  were  an  order  of  magnitude  more  important 
for  industries  in  technological  ﬂux  than  they  were  for  indus-
tries  centered  on  a  settled,  relatively  unchanging  technology. 
Companies tended to choose locations near the ﬁrms that made 
their  machines  in  large  part  because  of  the  significant  advan-
tages stemming from the interchange and feedback of users and  
producers—feedback that is especially valuable if designs are still

evolving. Doing so also meant being able to take advantage of 
a well-educated labor force familiar with machinery and able to 
adapt to using slightly different machines in somewhat different 
ways. As industries reached technological maturity, their produc-
tion processes tended to settle into static patterns, and their busi-
ness models became ones in which sales were made on the basis 
of the lowest price. It was at this level of maturity that industries 
and companies tended to migrate to the periphery of the world 
economy.

BECAUSE  SOCIAL  DEMOCRACY  WAS  democracy,  people  could 
choose at the ballot box how much income and wealth inequal-
ity they were willing to accept. They could vote for more or less 
progressive  taxes.  They  could  opt  to  either  expand  or  contract 
the set of public and semi-public goods and of benefits offered 
to  all  citizens.  And  they  could  expand  or  contract  the  benefits 
offered  to  the  poor.  But  fundamentally,  social  democracy  as  a 
system was built on the premise that universal redistribution was 
desirable because all citizens wanted to be insured against the risk 
of poverty. Incentives for maximizing production were fine, too. 
However, the trick was the question of how to balance insurance 
against risk and incentives for production, a matter of both judg-
ment and politics. Wherever it took root, social democracy strove 
for programs that leaked small amounts of redistributed income, 
all while aiming for the utilitarian greatest good of the greatest 
number.

For these reasons, social democracy was a powerful force. But 
there was a problem. It would in the end, perhaps, bring about the 
demise of social democracy and the rise of what became known 
as “neoliberalism”: there remained, in the shadows, a memory of 
the belief that the market economy was not society’s servant, but 
its master—that social democratic attempts to vindicate Polany-
ian rights would impose a crushing burden that would severely

hobble long-run economic growth, and would not produce so-
cial justice because universalist provision of benefits would make 
equals of people who should not be equals.

Perhaps there was, at bottom, a near-innate human aversion 
to  even  semi-centralized  redistributive  arrangements  that  take 
from some and give to others. Humans, at least we humans, see 
society as a network of reciprocal gift-exchange relationships. As 
a general principle, we agree that all of us do much better if we 
do things for one another rather than requiring that individuals 
do everything for themselves. We do not always want to be the 
receiver: it makes us feel small and inadequate. We do not always 
want  to  be  the  giver:  that  makes  us  feel  exploited  and  grifted. 
And as a matter of principle and practice, we tend to disapprove 
whenever we spy a situation in which somebody else seems to be 
following a life strategy of always being the receiver.17

Moreover, what it means to be a “giver” or a “receiver” is con-
tested. Are mothers raising children without a partner performing 
the hard and incredibly valuable work of raising the next gener-
ation, whose Social Security taxes will fund our Social Security 
checks? Or are they “welfare queens,” who are milking a system 
because it is easier, as their critics confidently declare, than get-
ting and holding a job? Is a moneylender a giver when he forgives 
you half of the interest you owe, but holds you to the principal 
sum and the other half of the interest?

The logic of social democracy is that we are all equals as cit-
izens, and equals should not be treated unequally without good 
cause. In a market economy, the good cause that justifies inequal-
ity is that we need to incentivize economic growth by rewarding 
skill, industry, and foresight, even if doing so inevitably involves 
rewarding good luck as well.

But  what  happens  when  some  citizens  think  that  they— 
because  of  birth,  education,  skin  color,  religious  affiliation,  or 
some other characteristic—are more equal than others? And what 
of those who, in the case of means-tested programs, seem to be

receiving not because they have bad luck, but simply because they 
never contribute?

These dilemmas can be papered over as long as employment 
stays high and growth stays strong. But when growth slows and 
employment becomes less certain, the fear that the “moochers” 
are  taking  advantage  gains  ever  greater  sway.  And  this  fear  of 
moochers was a significant part of what prompted the downfall 
of social democracy and the turn toward neoliberalism.

At the same time that social democracies were striving to treat 
their citizens equally through redistributive programs, they embarked 
on another, stranger endeavor. All over the world, in industrialized 
and developing areas alike, social democratic governments—even 
the most anti-communist among them—got it into their heads that 
they should run and operate businesses.

Consider the case of Britain’s government under Prime Min-
ister  Clement  Attlee,  Winston  Churchill’s  immediate  successor 
after World War II. In the late 1940s, the Attlee government na-
tionalized  the  Bank  of  England,  the  railways,  the  airlines,  tele-
phones,  coal  mining,  electric  power  generation,  long-distance 
trucking,  iron  and  steel,  and  natural  gas  provision.  Officially, 
management policy did not change once industries were nation-
alized:  commercial  profitability  remained  the  official  objective  
(although it was pursued with less vigor, especially when the pur-
suit of profitability might involve, say, closing plants and factories).
In retrospect, the social democratic insistence on government 
production of goods and services is puzzling. Governments were 
not merely demanding, nor distributing, nor regulating prices and 
quality. They were engaged in production. All over the world, the 
belief that large chunks of productive industry ought to be pub-
licly owned and managed dominated the mid-twentieth century. 
Even today, in the twenty-first century, there are still immense 
state-owned  and  state-managed  enterprises:  railroads,  hospitals, 
schools,  power  generating  facilities,  steelworks,  chemical  facto-
ries, coal mines, and others.

None of which have ever been part of governments’ core com-
petence. Organizations such as hospitals and railroads ought to be 
run with an eye on efficiency: getting the most produced with the 
resources available. But the logic that shapes how governments 
operate is different: it is the logic of the adjustments made in light 
of conflicting interests. As a result, government-managed enter-
prises—whether the coal mines of Britain or the telecommuni-
cations  monopolies  of  Western  Europe  or  the  oil-production 
monopolies of developing nations—have tended to be inefficient 
and wasteful.

Some of the organizations and industries being nationalized 
were ones for which you do not want “efficiency” over all else. 
There are times when you want “soft” rather than “hard” incen-
tives: a health clinic that is paid by insurance companies should 
not be replacing antibiotic solutions with colored water in order 
to decrease its costs. A company running an electricity distribu-
tion network should not skimp on maintenance in order to boost 
its current profits.

But the cases in which “soft” incentives are desirable are not 
that many: only when consumers are poor judges of quality, or 
when they are unable to vote with their feet by switching to al-
ternative suppliers. Almost everywhere else the hard material in-
centives that motivate for-profit enterprise are more appropriate.
So why did social democratic states, all to varying degrees, do 

it? There seem to have been three main reasons:

The first was an inordinate fear of monopolies. The leaders of 
these governments believed that economies of scale would ulti-
mately lead to the domination of a single firm in most industries, 
which  would  then  exploit  the  public  mercilessly  unless  it  was 
owned by the state. The second was a fear of attendant corrup-
tion, or the fear that the monopoly bosses would simply buy off 
the regulators. And third, the push for nationalization was moti-
vated by a resurgence of the classical Marxist belief that the mar-
ket was inherently exploitative—and that such exploitation could

be avoided by eliminating the private ownership of the means of 
production.

All of these beliefs seem naïve to us now. If the market is in-
herently corrupted by exploitation, what do we think of bureau-
cratic hierarchies? Yes, monopoly is to be feared. Yes, there are 
grave problems in a world in which much economic life depends 
on increasing returns to scale for the controlling monopoly. But 
a  publicly  managed  monopoly  is  still  a  monopoly.  Ultimately, 
the efforts on the part of social democracies to operate the “com-
manding heights” of their economies ended in disappointment, 
which  hurt  the  long-term  political  support  for  the  project  of  
social democracy.

This problem, however, was small beer compared to damage 
that would be wrought by the inflation crises of the 1970s in the 
United States. For much of that decade, the US rate of inflation 
bounced between 5 percent and 10 percent annually, an unprec-
edented pace, as unemployment also reached painful and unsus-
tainable levels. How did it happen?

In the 1960s, the administration of President Lyndon John-
son was unwilling to accept a floor or even an average of around 
5 percent or so unemployment, and so set its sights on pushing 
that number lower. As Johnson economic adviser Walter Heller 
put it, “The government must step in to provide the essential sta-
bility [of the economy] at high levels of employment and growth 
that the market mechanism, left alone, cannot deliver.” The task 
was no longer just to avoid depressions, but to attain high levels of 
employment—and growth.

This ambitious new mission raised an important question: 
Would it be possible to maintain the balance of supply and de-
mand while pushing the unemployment rate below 5 percent? 
In  other  words,  could  the  unemployment  rate  stay  this  low 
without accelerating inﬂation? By 1969 the answer was reason-
ably clear: no.

Average nonfarm nominal wage growth in the United States 
had ﬂuctuated around or below 4 percent per year between the 
end of the Korean War and the mid-1960s. It had jumped to 
more than 6 percent in 1968. Moreover, a half-decade of slowly 
rising inflation had led people to begin to pay attention to what 
was happening. People make all sorts of decisions based on their 
expectations  of  what  next  year’s  price  level  will  be:  decisions 
about how much to demand, in terms of cash to hold on to and 
of prices and wages to charge. An episodic excess supply of money 
can cause unexpected inflation. But when people look back on 
the past half-decade or so and see that there has been an excess 
supply of money during that time, they will expect inflation in 
the years ahead. This can become doubly damning. The price 
level will jump in part as expected, and in part as unexpected. 
And  the  total  inflation  rate—expected  plus  unexpected—will 
accelerate upward.

The  sharp  rise  in  inflation  came  as  a  surprise  to  the  John-
son administration. Macroeconomist Robert Gordon later remi-
nisced on the analytical framework that had been reliable before 
and that they had been using, saying it “collapsed with amazing 
speed after 1967.” He and his economist peers, who had recently 
all  obtained  their  graduate  degrees  and  started  their  first  jobs, 
“were acutely aware of the timing of this turn of the tide, . . . and 
almost immediately found our graduate school education incapa-
ble of explaining the evolution of the economy.”18

Economic advisers to both Johnson and, before him, Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy had argued that a substantial reduction in 
unemployment could be achieved with only a moderate increase 
in inﬂation. But expectations of inflation became “unanchored.” 
Prices and wages were not set to an expectation of price stabil-
ity,  or  even  to  a  slow  upward  creep  in  inflation,  but  rather  to 
last year’s inflation, which had become the new normal. Over the 
four years from 1965 to 1969, the Federal Reserve accommodated

President Johnson’s desire to reduce unemployment by expand-
ing the money supply, to keep interest rates low, and then Viet-
nam  War  spending  unbalanced  by  higher  taxes  overheated  the 
economy further. By 1969, the United States was not a 2 percent 
but a 5 percent per year inflation economy.

President Richard Nixon took office in 1969, and the econo-
mists of the incoming Republican administration planned to ease 
inﬂation with only a small increase in unemployment by reduc-
ing government spending and encouraging the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates. Their plan only half-worked: unemployment 
did indeed rise—from 3.5 percent to almost 6 percent between 
1969 and 1971, but inﬂation barely budged.

This outcome presented a great mystery. Up until this point, 
it looked as though the US economy had been sliding back and 
forth  along  a  stable  inﬂation-unemployment  “Phillips  Curve” 
(named  after  economist  A.  William  Phillips).  Democratic  gov-
ernments tended to spend more time at the left end of the curve, 
with  relatively  low  unemployment.  Republican  governments 
tended to spend more time at the right end, with relatively low 
inﬂation and higher unemployment. But by both absolute stan-
dards and historical standards, both inﬂation and unemployment 
were low. Nixon’s economists had intended to move the econ-
omy from the left to the right side of the curve, but now they 
found that it would not go.

Their  attempts  to  ﬁght  inﬂation  by  marginally  increasing 
unemployment no longer worked because no one believed that 
the administration would have the fortitude to continue those 
efforts  for  very  long.  Autoworkers,  for  example,  believed  that 
the government would not allow widespread unemployment in 
the automobile industry—and would step in to help by pump-
ing  up  nominal  demand,  and  giving  people  enough  liquidity 
to buy cars if ever the industry’s sales began to drop. This left 
the  United  Auto  Workers  without  any  incentive  to  moderate 
its wage demands—and automobile manufacturers without any

incentive  to  resist  those  demands:  they  could  simply  pass  the 
increased costs on to consumers in higher prices.

This unexpected result of their efforts left Nixon’s economists 
in a difficult situation. One possible “solution” was to create a 
truly  massive  recession:  to  make  it  painfully  clear  that  even  if 
inﬂation  rose  to  painful  levels,  the  government  would  not  ac-
commodate, and would keep unemployment high until inﬂation 
came down. No president wanted to think about this possibility. 
It was, in the end, the road the United States took, but largely by 
accident and after many stopgaps.

Confronted with an unemployment rate of 6 percent, an in-
flation  rate  of  5  percent,  and  a  loud  chorus  of  complaints  that 
he had mismanaged the economy, Nixon could see the political 
winds shifting against him. Arthur Burns, the president’s former 
counselor, newly installed as chair of the Federal Reserve, gloomily 
predicted that it would take a large recession to reduce inflation-
ary expectations via market mechanisms, and that enacting such 
a plan would put him out of a job. Congress, he surmised, would 
vote overwhelmingly to fire a Federal Reserve chair who created 
such a large recession. To Nixon, the political situation was pain-
fully familiar: back in 1960, as a vice president running for presi-
dent, he and then Eisenhower aide Arthur Burns had begged their 
boss, President Eisenhower, not to let unemployment rise during 
the 1960 election year. Eisenhower had turned them down, and 
Nixon had narrowly lost the 1960 election to Kennedy.19

This time, Nixon decided on a version of “shock therapy”: 
suspend  the  pegged-but-flexible  exchange-rate  system  put  in 
place back during Bretton Woods (the suspension would even-
tually become permanent), impose wage and price controls to re-
duce inflation, and make sure that Arthur Burns, his Fed chair, 
understood that unemployment needed to be lower and declin-
ing as the election of 1972 approached. Nixon’s political calcula-
tions, however, were not entirely to blame for the upward burst 
in inflation. Many economists, including Johnson adviser Walter

Heller, believed that Nixon’s policies were not nearly stimulative 
and inflationary enough.

In practice, the supply of money greatly outran demand, and 
as  Nixon’s  price  controls  were  lifted,  inflation  accelerated  ever 
upward.

In retrospect, we might wonder if there was any way Nixon 
could have reduced inflation back to a “normal” rate of 3 per-
cent or so, or at least contained it at less than 6 percent. On a 
technical level, of course, he could have. It was around the same 
time that West Germany became the ﬁrst economy to undertake 
a  “disinﬂation.”  The  peak  of  German  inﬂation  came  in  1971: 
thereafter the Bundesbank pursued policies that did not tend to 
accommodate supply shocks or other upward pressures on inﬂa-
tion. By the early 1980s, West German inﬂation was invisible. 
Japan began a similar disinﬂation effort in the mid-1970s, while 
Britain and France waited until later to begin their disinﬂations. 
France’s last year of double-digit inﬂation was 1980; Britain’s was 
1981.20

Given these examples, there were no “technical” obstacles to 
making the burst of moderate inﬂation the United States experi-
enced in the late 1960s a quickly reversed anomaly. But Arthur 
Burns did not dare.

Burns lacked confidence that he could reduce inflation with-
out driving up unemployment to unacceptable levels. In 1959, as 
president of the American Economic Association, he delivered an 
annual address that he called “Progress Toward Economic Stabil-
ity.”21 Burns spent the bulk of his speech detailing how automatic 
stabilizers  and  monetary  policy  based  on  a  better  sense  of  the 
workings of the banking system had made episodes like the Great 
Depression of the past extremely unlikely. Toward the end of his 
talk, he spoke of what he saw as an unresolved problem created by 
the progress toward economic stability: “a future of secular inﬂa-
tion.” Workers had hesitated to demand wage increases in excess 
of productivity growth during booms when they had the market

power  to  do  so  because  they  feared  the  consequences  of  being 
too expensive to their employers in the depressions to come. But 
what if there were no depressions to come?

Then, after 1972, came the oil shocks. First, world oil prices 
tripled in response to the Yom Kippur War of 1973, and they 
tripled again in the wake of the Iranian Revolution of 1979, as 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) re-
alized how much market power it had.

It is possible that the second tripling was an intended result of 
US foreign policy. Back in the early 1970s, Nixon’s chief foreign 
policy adviser, Henry Kissinger, wanted to strengthen the shah of 
Iran as a possible counterweight to Soviet inﬂuence in the Middle 
East. With the oil price tripled, the shah was indeed immensely 
strengthened—at the price of enormous economic damage to the 
industrial West and to the rest of the developing world, which 
saw its oil bill multiply many times over. It is certain that the 
economic repercussions of the oil price rise came as a surprise to 
the Nixon administration—Kissinger always thought economic 
matters were boring and unimportant, in spite of the fact that the 
military and diplomatic strength of the United States depended 
on them. It is most likely that the rise in oil prices struck the ad-
ministration as not worthy of concern, and certainly not worth 
the trouble of combatting—it did, after all, strengthen the shah. 
Few had any conception of the economic damage it might do, 
and those few were not listened to by the US government.

Because oil was the key energy input in the world economy, 
the  shock  of  these  price  increases  reverberated  throughout  the 
world, and eventually they would lead to the double-digit annual 
inflation of the late 1970s.

The first of the inflation spikes, the one triggered by the Yom 
Kippur  War  oil  price  increases,  sent  the  world  economy  into 
one of the deepest recessions of the post–World War II period, 
leaving the US economy with high inﬂation that would eventu-
ally lead to another recession in 1980–1982, the deepest of the

post–World  War  II  era.  Each  surge  in  inﬂation  was  preceded 
by  or  coincided  with  a  sharp  increase  in  unemployment.  And 
throughout the late 1960s and the 1970s, each cycle was larger 
than the one before it: in 1971, unemployment peaked at around 
6 percent; in 1975, at about 8.5 percent; and in 1982–1983 at 
nearly 11 percent.

By the time the 1975 recession had hit its worst point, people 
were ready to try something new. In that year, Senator Hubert 
Humphrey  (D-MN),  a  former  presidential  contender,  cospon-
sored a bill with Congressman Augustus Hawkins (D-CA) that 
would have required the government to reduce unemployment 
to 3 percent within four years and offer employment to anyone 
who  wanted  it  at  the  same  “prevailing  wage”  paid  for  govern-
ment  construction  projects.  In  its  House  version,  the  bill  also 
granted  individuals  the  right  to  sue  in  federal  court  for  their 
Humphrey-Hawkins jobs if the federal government failed to pro-
vide them. In early 1976, observers felt the bill had a high prob-
ability of passing, though President Gerald Ford, a Republican, 
was likely to veto it. Indeed, many assumed that Humphrey and 
Hawkins’  primary  intention  was  to  bait  Ford  into  vetoing  the 
bill, thereby creating an issue for his challenger, Jimmy Carter, to 
campaign on during the upcoming 1976 election.

What happened in fact was that the Humphrey-Hawkins bill 
was watered down, and watered down, and watered down again 
until it was essentially a set of declarations that the Federal Re-
serve should try to do good things—completely without teeth as 
far  as  shaping  actual  policy  was  concerned.  Ultimately,  Jimmy 
Carter prevailed in the 1976 election. And the most important 
long-term effect of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill was, perhaps, to 
make it difficult in the late 1970s to propose policies to reduce 
inflation. Any measure that risked at least a temporary rise in un-
employment was deemed a nonstarter.

By the end of the 1970s, inflation was perceived to be out of 

control.

Thirty Glorious Years of Social Democracy 

From an economist’s perspective, an inflationary episode like 
what happened in the United States in the 1970s might not seem 
to matter much. Prices go up. But wages and profits go up as 
well. In other words, economists might argue, inflation is a zero- 
sum redistribution. Some lose, but others gain as much. With 
no strong reason to think that the losers are in any sense more 
deserving  than  the  gainers,  economists  might  ask,  why  should 
anyone, including economists, care very much?

This view is profoundly misguided. To understand why, we 
need  only  return  to  John  Maynard  Keynes’s  assessment  of  the 
consequences of inflation during and after World War I: “There 
is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of 
society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the 
hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and 
does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to 
diagnose.” Keynes was speaking of high inflation: enough to take 
“all  permanent  relations  between  debtors  and  creditors,  which 
form  the  ultimate  foundation  of  capitalism,”  and  make  them  
“utterly disordered”—and the inflation of the 1970s, while se-
vere, was nothing of the sort.22

But woven through this passage is another effect of inflation: 
one can usually pretend that there is a logic to the distribution of 
wealth—that behind a person’s prosperity lies some rational ba-
sis, whether it is that person’s hard work, skill, and farsightedness, 
or  some  ancestor’s.  Inflation—even  moderate  inflation—strips 
the mask. There is no rational basis. Rather, “those to whom the 
system  brings  windfalls . . . become  profiteers,”  Keynes  wrote, 
and “the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and 
a lottery.”23

And a government that generates such inflation is obviously 
not  competent.  By  the  late  1970s,  all  critics  of  social  democ-
racy had to do was point at the inflation and ask: Would a well- 
functioning political-economic system have produced this? And 
the answer was no.

The Neoliberal Turn

H istory does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme—oddly. The 

period from 1945 to 1975 was an economic El Dorado that 
rhymed with the previous years of economic El Dorado, 1870–
1914.  And  the  post-1975  breakdown  of  that  second  golden  
age had some rhymes with the failure to stitch the first golden age 
back together after the end of World War I.

The  period  after  the  American  Civil  War,  1870–1914,  the 
first economic El Dorado, had been an age of a swift jog or even 
a run along the path toward utopia at a pace previously unseen 
in any historical era. For the poor majority, it delivered greatly 
lessened pressures for necessity and material want. For the rich, 
it brought a near-utopia of material abundance: by 1914, life of-
fered,  “at  a  low  cost  and  with  the  least  trouble,  conveniences, 
comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and 
most powerful monarchs of other ages.” Moreover, civilization’s 
confidence as of 1914 was great. For the well-thinking, any idea 
that this progressive economic system of rapidly increasing pros-
perity might break down was, as Keynes put it, “aberrant [and] 
scandalous.”1 Yet then came World War I, and the failures of eco-
nomic management after World War I to restore stability, con-
fidence in the system, and the prewar rate of rapidly advancing 
prosperity. And so things fell apart. The center did not hold.

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

Here I need to issue a warning: The time since the beginning 
of the neoliberal turn overlaps my career. In it I have played, in 
a very small way, the roles of intellectual, commentator, thought 
leader,  technocrat,  functionary,  and  Cassandra.  I  have  been 
deeply  and  emotionally  engaged  throughout,  as  I  have  worked 
to advance policies for good and for ill, and as my engagement 
has alternately sharpened and blurred my judgment. From this 
point on this book becomes, in part, an argument I am having 
with my younger selves and with various voices in my head. The 
historian’s ideal is to see and understand, not advocate and judge. 
In dealing with post-1980, I try but I do not think I fully succeed.
After World War II, or, to be more precise, 1938–1973 in 
North America and 1945–1973 in Western Europe, came another 
economic El Dorado, an age of a swift jog or even a run along the 
path toward utopia at a pace previously unseen in any historical 
era—including 1870–1914. For the poor majority, it delivered 
relief from the pressures of dire necessity and access to consid-
erable  amounts  of  at  least  the  most  basic  conveniences  of  life. 
For the rich, it delivered a cornucopia of material abundance not 
just beyond the compass but beyond the wild imaginings of the 
richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages. Social democ-
racy  was  delivering.  Creative  destruction  might  eliminate  your 
job, but there would be another one as good or better because of 
full employment. And because of rapid productivity growth, your 
income would certainly be higher than that of the typical person 
of  your  accomplishments  and  position  in  any  previous  genera-
tion. And if you did not like what your neighborhood was or was 
becoming, you could buy a car and change your residence to the 
suburbs without disrupting the other parts of your life—at least if 
you were a white guy with a family in the global north.

Still,  civilization’s  confidence  as  of  1973  was  great,  fears  of 
the  ongoing  Cold  War  turning  hot  notwithstanding.  For  the 
well-thinking, any idea that this progressive economic system of 
rapidly increasing prosperity might break down was once again

aberrant and scandalous. In the global north, on average, people in 
1973 had between two and four times the material abundance that 
their parents had had a generation before. In the United States,  
especially, the talk was about how to deal with the end-state seen 
in  Keynes’s  “Economic  Possibilities  for  Our  Grandchildren”—
the civilization of material abundance, in which humanity’s prob-
lem was not how to produce enough to escape from the kingdom 
of necessity and have some useful conveniences, but rather “how 
to use . . . freedom from pressing economic cares . . . to live wisely 
and agreeably and well”2—fifty years before Keynes had predicted 
it might come to pass. Smokestacks and fog were no longer seen 
as welcome harbingers of prosperity, but as nuisances that needed 
to be squashed so we could have clean air. It was the time of The 
Greening of America, and of the expansion of human conscious-
ness. It was a time to question the bourgeois virtues of hard, regu-
lar work and thrift in pursuit of material abundance, and instead 
to turn on, tune in, drop out.

And if things did not fall apart, precisely, the center did not 
hold. There was a sharp neoliberal turn away from the previous 
order—social democracy—of 1945–1973. By 1979 the cultural 
and  political  energy  was  on  the  right.  Social  democracy  was 
broadly seen to have failed, to have overreached itself. A course 
correction was called for.

Why? In my view, the greatest cause was the extraordinary 
pace of rising prosperity during the Thirty Glorious Years, which 
raised the bar that a political-economic order had to surpass in or-
der to generate broad acceptance. People in the global north had 
come to expect to see incomes relatively equally distributed (for 
white guys at least), doubling every generation, and they expected 
economic  uncertainty  to  be  very  low,  particularly  with  respect 
to  prices  and  employment—except  on  the  upside.  And  people 
then for some reason required that growth in their incomes be at 
least as fast as they had expected and that it be stable, or else they 
would seek reform.

Karl Polanyi died in 1964, in Toronto.3 Had he been more 
listened-to,  he  could  have  warned  the  well-thinking  who  dis-
coursed in the years of rapid economic growth about how success-
ful management had brought about the end of bitter ideological 
struggles. People, he would have said—and did say—want their 
rights respected. While delivering increasing prosperity year by 
year can substitute for respect to a degree, it is only to a degree. 
And egalitarian distribution was a sword with at least two edges. 
People seek to earn, or to feel that they have earned, what they 
receive—not to be given it out of somebody’s grace, for that is 
not respectful. Moreover, many people don’t want those who are 
ranked lower than them to be treated as their equals, and may 
even see this as the greatest of all violations of their Polanyian 
societal rights.

As generations became accustomed to very rapid growth, the 
amount of increasing prosperity required to quiet the worries and 
concerns thrown up by market capitalism’s creative destruction 
grew  as  well.  The  bar  was  raised.  The  polities  and  economies 
of the late 1970s did not clear that bar. And so people looked 
around, searching for ideas about how to reform.

Say what you like about Benito Mussolini, Vladimir Lenin, 
and others who proposed all kinds of ideas about how to reform 
after, and indeed before, World War I, at least they were intellec-
tually creative. Very creative. But the things that were displayed 
in the shop windows in the marketplaces-of-ideas in the global 
north in the late 1970s were rather shopworn. On the left, there 
were declamations that what was going on behind the Iron and 
Bamboo Curtains in Brezhnev’s Russia and immediate post-Mao 
China was in fact glorious, and not just glorious—but success-
ful!4 On the right, there were declamations that everything had 
in fact been about to go fine when Hoover was defeated in 1932, 
and that the entire New Deal and all of social democracy were 
big mistakes.

But still, the late 1970s saw the generation of a rough con-
sensus that the global-north political economy needed substan-
tial reform, at the very least: that something in the shop window 
needed to be purchased.

One very powerful factor contributing to this consensus was 
that after 1973, in Europe and in the United States and in Japan, 
there was a very sharp slowdown in the rate of productivity and 
real income growth.5 Some of it was a consequence of the deci-
sion to shift from an economy that polluted more to an economy 
that  attempted  to  begin  the  process  of  environmental  cleanup. 
Cleanup, however, would take decades to make a real difference 
in people’s lives. Energy diverted away from producing more and 
into producing cleaner would quickly show up in lower wage in-
creases and profits. And some of it was a consequence of the up-
ward oil price shocks of 1973 and 1979—energy that had been 
devoted to raising labor productivity was now devoted to figuring 
out how to produce in a more energy-efficient manner, and how 
to produce in a flexible manner that could cope with either high 
or low relative energy prices. Some of it was also due to running 
out of the backlog stock of undeployed useful ideas that had been 
discovered and partially developed. Especially in Western Europe 
and in Japan, the easy days of post–World War II “catch-up” were 
over.  As  the  postwar  baby  boom  generation  entered  the  work-
force, making them fully productive proved a difficult task, and 
the failure to fully accomplish it was one source of drag.6 But it is 
difficult to gauge how much each of these sources contributed to 
the slowdown. It remains a mystery even today. The important 
thing was that the social democratic promise of ever-increasing 
prosperity was not kept in the 1970s.

The irritation of markedly slowed economic growth was am-
plified by inflation. Not, admittedly, the doubling or septupling 
inflation of the post–World War I period. Rather, 5 to 10 percent 
a year. The productivity slowdown meant that if nominal wages

were to keep rising at their previous pace, prices would have to 
rise  faster.  The  decade  starting  in  1966,  of  having,  almost  ev-
ery year, surprise upward shocks to the rate of growth of money 
prices  on  average,  convinced  businesses,  unions,  workers,  and 
consumers that (a) inflation needed to be paid attention to, and 
(b) it was likely to be the same as or a bit more than it had been 
last year—so you needed (c) to build into your planning the ex-
pectation that, over the next year, your wages and other people’s 
wages, and your prices and other people’s prices, would rise by at 
least as much as, and probably more than, they had last year. This 
then produced stagflation. If inflation were to stay constant, then 
employment  would  have  to  fall  below  full  employment  to  put 
pressure on workers to accept wage increases lower than they had 
expected. If the economy were to be at full employment, then the 
rate of inflation would have to creep upward.

The Organization of Oil Producing Countries imposed an oil 
embargo against the United States and the Netherlands in the af-
termath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and this deranged the oil 
market. OPEC woke up to its market power, and its maintenance 
of high oil prices sent the world economy into a major recession.7 
Moreover, high oil prices pushed the world economy to shift its 
direction, from focusing on raising labor productivity to focusing 
on energy conservation. That meant that many people’s incomes 
and jobs disappeared—permanently—and that many others’ fu-
ture jobs would fail to appear. And it meant an acceleration of the 
inflation that had already been in progress before 1973.

The tripling of world oil prices worked its way through the 
economy like a wave, which then reflected and passed through 
the economy again and again—not a one-time rise in the price 
level, but a permanent upward ratchet of the inflation rate. The 
rising rate of inflation from 1965 to 1973 predisposed people to 
take last year’s inflation as a signal of what next year’s inflation 
would be.8 And no one in a position to make anti-inﬂation policy 
cared enough about stopping inﬂation, given the likely high cost

of doing so in terms of idled factories and unemployed workers. 
Other goals took precedence: solving the energy crisis, or main-
taining a high-pressure economy, or making certain that the cur-
rent recession did not get any worse.

This inflation was an annoyance that governments found it 
damnably  hard  to  deal  with.  The  only  way  to  offset  these  ex-
pectations  was  to  scare  workers  and  businesses:  to  make  labor 
demand  weak  enough  that  workers  would  not  dare  demand 
wage increases in accordance with expected inflation, out of the 
fear  that  they  would  lose  their  jobs,  and  to  make  spending  in 
the economy as a whole weak enough that businesses would not 
dare  raise  prices  in  accordance  with  expected  inflation,  either. 
To hold inflation constant required a weak, low-profit, elevated- 
unemployment economy.

Inflation of 5 to 10 percent per year is not the trillionfold in-
flation of Weimar Germany. And productivity-growth slowdown 
is not productivity-growth stop. From 1973 to 2010, worker pro-
ductivity in the global north grew at an average rate of 1.6 percent 
per year. That is a significant drop from the 3 percent rate sus-
tained between 1938 and 1973. But from a long-term historical 
perspective, it was still a lot: 1.6 percent per year is essentially the 
same as the productivity growth rate over the period 1870–1914, 
that original economic El Dorado to which economists after 1918 
desperately wanted to return.

But after expectations had been set so high by the prosper-
ity of 1945–1973, 1.6 percent didn’t look so impressive. More-
over, post-1973 growth was accompanied by rising inequality. At 
the top, the average pace of real income growth continued at its 
1945–1973 pace, 3 percent per year, or even more. For the mid-
dle and the working classes of the global north, who were pay-
ing for continued steady growth for the upper middle class and 
the explosion of plutocrat wealth, it has meant inflation-adjusted 
paychecks growing at only 0.5 to 1 percent year. Plus there were 
the effects of inclusion: if you were of the “right” ethnicity and

gender in 1973, whatever satisfaction you got from your position 
in the pyramid leaked away as Blacks and women got “uppity.” 
And with at least some closing of race, ethnic, and gender income 
gaps, white male earnings, especially for those of relatively low 
education, had to, on average, lag behind the lower-middle and 
working-class average of 0.5 to 1 percent per year.

Inflation creating at least the appearance of great instability 
in incomes, oil shocks producing the first noticeable economic 
recessions since World War II, sociological turmoil and income 
stagnation—all of this makes some change likely. Still, the neo-
liberal turn, accomplished in little more than half a decade in the 
1970s, was remarkably rapid.

In the United States, the Vietnam War did not help. Presi-
dent Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger had blocked the ending 
of the war in late 1968, promising South Vietnamese president 
Nguyễn Văn Thiệu that they would get him a better deal and a 
better chance of long-term political survival than Lyndon John-
son’s administration was offering.9 They lied. After an additional 
1.5 million Vietnamese and 30,000 American deaths after 1968, 
North  Vietnam  conquered  South  Vietnam  in  mid-1975—and 
promptly began an ethnic cleansing campaign against Vietnamese 
of Chinese ancestral descent. Domestic discontent with the war 
was, for Nixon, a political plus: his strategy had always been one 
of ramping up culture-war divisions, in the belief that if he could 
break the country in two, the larger half would support him.

Yet even with all of the inflation, with the productivity slow-
down,  and  with  the  quagmire  land  war  in  Asia  and  Nixon’s 
crimes, things were still very good in terms of the rate of eco-
nomic growth and the indicia of societal progress, at least com-
pared to what had gone on between the world wars, or even in 
any decade between 1870 and 1914. Why, then, did the 1970s 
see  such  a  powerful  swing  against  the  social  democratic  polit-
ical-economic  order  that  had  managed  its  successful  balancing

act  since  World  War  II?  True,  the  US  death  toll  in  the  Viet-
nam War was high. But inflation, save for the somewhat elevated 
unemployment level, which turned out to be required to keep 
it  from  rising  further,  was  a  zero-sum  redistribution,  with  the 
gainers matching the losers. The productivity slowdown was a 
disappointment, but it still left wages growing faster than in any 
previous era of human history.

Those economists who minimized the downside of inflation 
should have listened more closely to Karl Polanyi. People do not 
just seek to have good things materially; they like to pretend that 
there is a logic to the distribution of the good things, and espe-
cially its distribution to them in particular—that their prosperity 
has some rational and deserved basis. Inflation—even the moder-
ate inflation of the 1970s—stripped the mask away.

There were, in right-wing eyes, additional problems with social 
democracy. Social democratic governments were simply trying to 
do too many things. Too much of what they were attempting was 
technocratically stupid, and bound to be unsuccessful, and many 
of the apparent defects they were trying to repair were not real de-
fects, but actually necessary to incentivize good and proper behav-
ior. Reagan’s future chief economist (and my brilliant, charismatic, 
and superb teacher) Martin Feldstein claimed that expansionary 
policies  “adopted  in  the  hope  of  lowering . . . unemployment” 
produced inflation: “Retirement beneﬁts were increased without 
considering  the  subsequent  impact  on  investment  and  saving. 
Regulations  were  imposed  to  protect  health  and  safety  without 
evaluating  the  reduction  in  productivity,”  he  wrote.  Moreover, 
“unemployment  beneﬁts  would  encourage  layoffs,”  and  welfare 
would “weaken family structures.”10

Marty, dedicated to trying as hard as he could to nail the em-
pirics right, and devoted to honest academic and scholarly debate, 
believed all this to the core of his being. We have seen this before. 
It is the conviction that authority and order are of overwhelming

importance, and that “permissiveness” is fatal. It is the opinion 
that,  again  in  the  words  of  Churchill’s  private  secretary,  P.  J. 
Grigg, an economy and polity cannot perpetually “live beyond its 
means on its wits.” It is the idea that the market economy has a 
logic of its own, and does what it does for reasons that are beyond 
feeble mortal comprehension, and that need to be respected, or 
else. It is the belief that believing you can rearrange and govern 
the market is hubris, and that it will bring about nemesis.

Yet Marty’s take was also not completely false. Why, in Brit-
ain, did social democratic education policy turn out to give chil-
dren of doctors and lawyers and landowners the right to go to 
Oxford for free? Why did social democracies that had nationalized 
the “commanding heights” of their economies use that power not 
to accelerate technological progress, and keep employment high, 
but rather, to prop up increasingly obsolete “sunset” industries? 
When judged by a technocratic logic of efficiency, all politically 
popular arrangements will turn out to be lacking to some degree. 
It is the broadness of the discontent and the rapidity of its reemer-
gence  after  a  decade  that,  compared  to  the  Great  Recession  of 
2008, or the COVID-19 plague of 2020–2021, does not appear 
to have been that large a shock—it is that that strikes me as inter-
esting. A tripling of global-north living standards between 1938 
and 1973 had not brought about utopia. Growth gets interrupted 
and slowed. And in less than a decade, all of this was felt to indi-
cate that social democracy needed to be replaced.

One  touchstone,  again,  is  British  left-wing  historian  Eric 
Hobsbawm. Hobsbawm saw the late 1970s and the subsequent 
discontent  with  the  social  democratic  order  as  justified,  writ-
ing, “There were good grounds for some of the disillusion with 
state-managed  industries  and  public  administration.”  He  de-
nounced the “rigidities, inefficiencies and economic wastages so 
often sheltering under Golden Age government policies.” And he 
declared that “there was considerable scope for applying the neo-
liberal cleansing-agent to the encrusted hull of many a good ship

‘Mixed Economy’ with beneficial results.” He went on with the 
clincher, saying that neoliberal Thatcherism had been necessary, 
and that there was a near-consensus about this after the fact: “Even 
the British Left was eventually to admit that some of the ruthless 
shocks imposed on the British economy by Mrs. Thatcher had 
probably been necessary.”11

Hobsbawm  was  a  lifelong  communist.  To  the  end  of  his 
days, he would continue to stubbornly maintain, while drinking 
tea with his respectful interviewers, that the murderous careers 
of Lenin and Stalin (but perhaps not Mao?) had been worth un-
dertaking, because they indeed might, had things turned out dif-
ferently, have unlocked the gate and opened the road to a true 
utopia.12 Yet he also eagerly attended the Church of the Thatcher-
ite Dispensation, where he heard and then himself preached the 
Lesson: the market giveth, the market taketh away; blessed be the 
name of the market.

So what was the global north going to purchase in the mar-
ketplace of ideas as its reform program? On the left there was very 
little. Really-existing socialism had proven a bust, yet too much 
energy on the left was still devoted to explaining away its failures. 
On the right there were real ideas. Never mind that to the histori-
cally minded they seemed to be largely retreads from before 1930. 
After all, many of the ideas of the New Deal had been retreads 
from  the  Progressive  Era  of  the  first  decade  of  the  1900s.  The 
right wing’s ideas were backed by lots of money. The memory of 
the Great Depression, and of austerity’s failures in the Great De-
pression, was old and fading. Once again cries for sound finance 
orthodoxy  and  austerity—even  for  the  gold  standard—were 
heard.  Once  again  the  standard  answer—that  everything  that 
went wrong was somehow an over-mighty gov ernment’s fault—
was trotted out. It was, after all, for true believers a metaphysical 
necessity that it was government intervention that had caused the 
Great Depression to be so deep and to last so long. The market, 
after all, could not fail: it could only be failed.

The fading memory of the Great Depression led to the fad-
ing of the belief, or rather recognition, by the middle class that 
they, as well as the working class, needed social insurance. In an 
environment of economic stability and growth, the successful 
not  only  prospered  materially  but  could  convince  themselves 
that they prospered morally as well, for they were the authors 
of  their  own  prosperity—and  government  existed  merely  to 
tax them unfairly, and then to give what was rightfully theirs 
to poorer, deviant people who lacked their industry and their 
moral worth.

From this point, the right-wing critique spread out to sweep 
up much more than a faltering economy. For the right wing also 
embraced a cultural critique, one squarely aimed at the very ad-
vances in racial and gender equality sketched above. Social de-
mocracy,  conservatives  declared  in  a  Polanyian  backlash,  was 
flawed  because  it  treated  unequals  equally.  Remember  Univer-
sity of Chicago economics professor and Nobel laureate George 
Stigler,  writing  in  1962—before  the  Civil  Rights  Act,  before  
the  Voting  Rights  Act,  before  affirmative  action—in  his  essay 
“The  Problem  of  the  Negro.”  As  he  saw  it,  Blacks  deserved  to 
be poor, to be disliked, and to be treated with disrespect: “The 
problem is that on average,” Stigler wrote, “he lacks a desire to 
improve himself, and lacks a willingness to discipline himself to 
this end.” And although prejudice might be part of the problem, 
“the Negro boy,” as Stigler put it, “is excluded from more occu-
pations by his own inferiority as a worker”: “Lacking education, 
lacking a tenacity of purpose, lacking a willingness to work hard, 
he  will  not  be  an  object  of  employers’  competition.”  And  the 
“Negro family,” he said, was, “on average, a loose, morally lax, 
group,” and brought into neighborhoods “a rapid rise in crime 
and vandalism.” “No statutes, no sermons, no demonstrations,” 
he concluded, would “obtain for the Negro the liking and respect 
that sober virtues commend.”13

The Neoliberal Turn

Social democracy set up a benchmark of treating everyone as 
equals.  Blacks,  knowing  that  American  society  had  dishonored 
the  promissory  note  they  had  been  passed,  demonstrated,  pro-
testing that America had written them a bad check. And those 
demonstrations, “growing in size and insolence,” as Stigler char-
acterized them, were a sign of things going wrong. Social democ-
racy was, to Stigler and company, economically inefficient. But 
it was also, in their eyes, profoundly unfair in its universalistic 
distribution of benefits. The word “insolence” is truly the tell.

Geopolitical  and  geo-economic  instability  comes  and  goes. 
The memory of the Great Depression was bound to fade. Could 
social democracy have held itself together if the inflation rate of 
the 1970s had not served as a convenient index of the incompe-
tence of “Keynesian” and social democratic governments, and as 
a focal point for calls for a return to more “orthodox” policies? Or 
was the deeper logic of the morality play saying that Keynesian 
social democrats had tried to create prosperity out of thin air, and 
so had gotten their comeuppance, bound to dominate eventually, 
somehow, someday? That morality-play version did become gen-
erally accepted in the corridors of influence and power. Might so-
cial democracy have survived, regrouped, and staggered onward? 
Here again is a place where a great deal of the course of history 
might,  or  might  not,  have  evolved  differently  had  a  relatively 
small number of influential groups of people thought different 
thoughts. But along this branch of the universe’s quantum wave 
function, at least, the world made a neoliberal turn.

FED  CHAIR  ARTHUR  BURNS  HAD  ALWAYS  BEEN  VERY  RELUC-
tant to use tools of tight monetary policy to reduce inflation at 
the risk of inducing a recession.14 When Jimmy Carter replaced 
Burns with G. William Miller, Miller likewise balked; he was un-
interested in causing (and likely being blamed for) a significant

recession.  Inflation  continued.  So  things  stood  in  1979.  Then 
Jimmy  Carter  found  himself  disappointed  with  the  state  of  his 
government,  as  well  as  of  the  economy.  He  decided,  suddenly, 
to  fire  five  cabinet  members,  including  his  treasury  secretary,  
Michael Blumenthal.

Carter’s aides told him that he couldn’t just fire the treasury 
secretary without naming a replacement—it would look like he 
was running a disorganized White House. But Carter was run-
ning a disorganized White House. There was no obvious replace-
ment at hand. To placate his aides, and the press, Carter decided 
to move G. William Miller over from the Fed to the Treasury.

Carter’s aides then told him that he couldn’t just leave a va-
cancy as Fed chair without naming a replacement—it would look 
like  he  was  running  a  disorganized  White  House.  But  Carter 
was running a disorganized White House. There was no obvious 
replacement at hand. So Carter grabbed the most senior career 
Treasury  Department  and  Federal  Reserve  official—New  York 
Federal  Reserve  Bank  president  Paul  Volcker—and  made  him 
Federal Reserve chair.15

As best as I can determine, there was no more than a cursory 
inquiry into what Volcker’s policy preferences might turn out 
to be.

One thing soon became clear, however: Volcker believed that 
there was now a mandate to ﬁght inﬂation even at the cost of 
inducing  a  signiﬁcant  recession.  And  he  was  ready  to  use  that 
mandate to bring inflation under control. By raising interest rates 
high enough and keeping them high long enough, he hoped to 
convince the economy that things were different, and that infla-
tion would stay below 5 percent per year indefinitely. In 1982 the 
unemployment  rate  kissed  11  percent.  The  United  States,  and 
the  world,  for  the  first  time  since  the  Great  Depression,  expe-
rienced an economic downturn for which the word “recession” 
seems too mild a description.

The Neoliberal Turn

Many observers would say that the costs of the Volcker dis-
inflation of the early 1980s were worth paying. After 1984, the 
United  States  boasted  an  economy  with  relatively  stable  prices 
and—up until 2009—relatively moderate unemployment; with-
out  Volcker’s  push,  inﬂation  would  have  likely  continued  to 
slowly creep upward over the 1980s, from just under 10 percent 
to perhaps as high as 20 percent per year. Others insist there must 
have been a better way. Perhaps inﬂation could have been brought 
under control more cheaply if government, business, and labor 
had been able to strike a deal to restrain nominal wage growth. 
Or perhaps if the Federal Reserve had done a better job of com-
municating  its  expectations  and  targets.  Perhaps  “gradualism” 
rather than “shock therapy” would have worked. Or is “gradual-
ism” inherently non-credible and ineffective, and the shock of a 
discrete “regime shift” necessary to re-anchor expectations?16

For those on the right, there is no question that the Volcker 
disinflation was necessary—indeed, long delayed past its proper 
time. One of the charges that right-wingers leveled at social de-
mocracy was that it led people to expect that life would be easy, 
that there would be full employment, that jobs would be plenti-
ful. This, in turn, encouraged workers to be insufficiently differ-
ential, and to demand too-high wages, spurring inflation, which 
kept profits too low to justify investment. And since it promised 
to  reward  even  those  who  had  not  pleased  previous  employers 
with jobs, it undermined public virtue.

The government and Federal Reserve needed to impose dis-
cipline by focusing on price stability, the right-wingers insisted, 
and  then  let  the  unemployment  rate  go  wherever  it  needed  to 
go. Government couldn’t be a “nanny state” offering everybody 
a bottle when they cried. Monetary policy needed to be turned 
over to strongly anti-inflationary policy makers—as Jimmy Car-
ter had already done, half- or unwittingly, in turning the Federal 
Reserve over to Paul Volcker. And if the Fed was strong enough

and disciplined enough, conservatives argued, inflation could be 
stopped with only a small and temporary rise in unemployment. 
And, stated and unstated, without upending the conservative cul-
tural hierarchies.

But  it  was  not  just  in  the  United  States.  Union  wage  de-
mands and strikes in Britain—especially public-sector strikes— 
convinced the center of the electorate that union power needed 
to be curbed, and that only the Conservatives would have the 
necessary  resolve.  Labour  governments  just  were  not  working. 
Margaret Thatcher’s Tories promised a restoration of order and 
discipline, and also promised that they would produce full em-
ployment  and  low  inflation,  and  make  Britain  work  again.  In 
France,  newly  installed  socialist  president  François  Mitterrand 
turned on a dime and embraced the neoliberal turn to inflation 
control and orthodox austerity. Volcker disinflation policies in 
the United States raised unemployment throughout the North 
Atlantic, putting the project of social democracy in even more of 
a difficult position, as many social democracies now could not 
even keep their own commitments to full employment.

Such  were  the  circumstances  in  which  Ronald  Reagan  and 
Margaret Thatcher came to power. They would remain at the top 
of their respective countries’ political establishments for much of 
the 1980s, and their shadows would dominate the thinking of 
the political right—and the center, and the center-left—in their 
countries thereafter for much longer.

Yet  the  curious  thing  is  that  the  domestic  policies  of  both 
Reagan and Thatcher were, judged from any rational perspective, 
unsuccessful.  There  was  a  larger  than  usual  gap  between  their 
promises and their accomplishments. They sought to raise em-
ployment and wages by removing debilitating regulations. They 
sought to end inflation by stabilizing money. They sought to boost 
investment, enterprise, and growth by cutting taxes—especially 
for the rich. And they sought to reduce the size of the government 
by using their tax cuts to force government spending onto a diet.

The Neoliberal Turn

The world could have been such that these were all, by and large, 
good ideas that would have advanced general prosperity.

Many politicians and strategists predicted that Reagan’s and 
Thatcher’s policies would be extremely popular and successful. 
Tax cuts would please electorates. They would also substantially 
weaken  opposition  to  subsequent  spending  cuts:  any  proposal 
to maintain spending would then necessarily include large bud-
get deﬁcits. Moreover, tax cuts would have the added benefit of 
tilting  income  distribution  in  favor  of  the  rich,  correcting  the 
excesses of social democracy by reversing its equal treatment of 
unequals. The tax cuts would ensure that industry was rewarded, 
and sloth punished. The logics of Stigler et al. would be appeased.
Yet  the  predicted  good  things  did  not  happen—except  for 
the end of inflation, enforced at heavy cost in people made un-
employed and people made poor by Paul Volcker.17 And except 
for  the  large  tax  cuts  for  the  rich,  which  began  the  process  of 
destabilizing  the  distribution  of  income  in  a  way  that  has  led 
to  our  Second  Gilded  Age.  Recovery  toward  full  employment 
was  unimpressive  both  in  Western  Europe  and  in  the  United 
States. Indeed, unemployment remained scarily high in Western 
Europe.  Rapid  wage  growth  did  not  resume.  Government  did 
not shrink—instead, it dealt with lower tax revenues by running 
up budget deficits. Investment, enterprise, and growth did not 
accelerate, in part because the big budget deficits soaked up fi-
nancing  that  otherwise  could  have  added  to  the  capital  stock. 
The value of the dollar became excessively high and deranged as 
a consequence of the large government appetite for finance, and 
so the market sent a false “shrink and shutdown” signal to Amer-
ican Midwestern manufacturing.18 The gap between promise and 
accomplishment was largest in the United States. Thatcher did  
accomplish  her  goal  of  curbing  the  British  union  movement. 
And she had promised less than Reagan had.

The Reagan administration also planned a massive military 
buildup—an  expansion,  not  a  contraction,  of  the  size  of  the

government.  How  was  greater  spending  to  be  reconciled  with 
lower taxes and balanced budgets? Policy elites assured each other 
that their candidate would say a lot of silly things before the elec-
tion, but that he and his principal advisers understood the im-
portant issue. Tax cuts were to be followed by a ruthless attack 
against programs such as farm subsidies, subsidized student loans, 
the exemption from taxation of Social Security income, the sub-
sidization  of  the  Southwest’s  water  projects,  and  so  forth.  The 
“weak claims” to the federal government’s money would get their 
just  deserts.  But  those  who  had  weak  claims  on  a  technocratic 
level,  and  yet  benefited  from  government  subsidies,  did  so  be-
cause they had, and were good at exercising, political power.

To reduce anxiety, Reagan and his allies increasingly pushed 
the idea that no spending cuts at all would be required: lifting the 
hand of regulation from the economy, combined with tax cuts, 
would spur economic growth enough to quickly reverse the defi-
cits. It would be “morning in America.”

No one with a quantitative grasp of the government’s budget 
and its pattern of change ever meant this story to be taken seri-
ously.  But  the  broader  administration  welcomed  its  dissemina-
tion. In fact, the tax cuts, the expansion of the military budget, 
and the disarray over spending cuts left the United States with 
large budget deﬁcits throughout the 1980s. Previous decades had 
seen one, or perhaps two, years of large budget deﬁcits, and only 
during deep recessions. But the 1980s saw large budget deﬁcits 
persist throughout years of prosperity and low unemployment as 
well. This was a bitter outcome for those who had worked hard 
to elect a Republican administration because they thought Dem-
ocrats  would  impoverish  America’s  future  by  pursuing  short-
sighted, anti-growth policies.

After  the  US  economy  reattained  the  neighborhood  of  full 
employment in the mid-1980s, the Reagan deficits diverted about 
4 percent of national income from investment into consumption 
spending: instead of flowing out of savers’ pockets through banks

to companies that would buy and install machines, finance flowed 
out of savers’ pockets through banks into the government, where 
it funded the tax cuts for the rich, so the rich could then spend 
their windfalls on luxury consumption. Such large and previously 
unseen  deficits  in  a  near-full  employment  economy  would  by 
themselves typically have inflicted a 0.4 percent per year nega-
tive drag on productivity and income growth. Plus there was the 
substantial indirect harm done to US economic growth by the 
Reagan deficit cycle. For more than half of the 1980s the US dol-
lar was substantially overvalued as the US budget deﬁcit sucked 
in capital from outside and raised the exchange rate. When a do-
mestic industry’s costs are greater than the prices at which foreign 
ﬁrms can sell, the market is sending the domestic industry a signal 
that it should shrink: foreigners are producing with more rela-
tive efficiency, and the resources used in the domestic industry 
would be put to better use in some other sector, where domestic 
producers have more of a comparative advantage. This was the 
signal that the market system sent to all US manufacturing indus-
tries in the 1980s: that they should cut back on investment and 
shrink. In this case, it was a false signal—sent not by the market’s 
interpretation of the logic of comparative advantage, but by the 
extraordinary short-run demand of cash to borrow from the US 
government. But ﬁrms responded nevertheless. The US sectors 
producing tradable goods shrank. And some of the ground lost 
would never be recovered. The Reagan tax cuts hammered man-
ufacturing in the Midwest, starting the creation of what is now 
known as the “Rust Belt.”

Thus the neoliberal turn, in the form it took during the Rea-
gan  administration,  did  not  end  the  slowdown  in  productivity 
growth but reinforced it. Moreover, the size of the government 
relative  to  the  economy  was  not  improved.  The  technocratic 
quality of public regulation was not raised. The major effect was 
to set the distribution of income on a trend of sharply increasing 
inequality.

The root problem was that the world just did not seem to 

work as those advocating for the neoliberal turn had predicted.

Back  in  1979,  a  year  before  Reagan’s  election,  Milton  and 
Rose  Friedman  wrote  their  classic  book  Free  to  Choose:  A  Per-
sonal Statement, in which they set out to defend their brand of 
small-government libertarianism. In the book, they made three 
powerful factual claims—claims that seemed true, or maybe true, 
at the time, but that we now know to be pretty clearly false. And 
their case for small-government libertarianism rested largely on 
those claims.19

The first claim was that macroeconomic distress is caused by 
governments, not by the instability of private markets, because 
the macroeconomic policy required to produce stability with low 
inflation and full-as-possible employment is straightforward, and 
easily achieved by a competent government that knows its limits. 
It is only because governments try to do too much that we expe-
rience difficult fluctuations. The second claim was that externali-
ties (such as pollution) were relatively small, and better dealt with 
via contract and tort law than through government regulation. 
Their third and most important claim was that, in the absence 
of  government-mandated  discrimination,  the  market  economy 
would produce a sufficiently egalitarian distribution of income. 
The  equality  of  equals  would  be  achieved,  and  the  equality  of 
unequals would be avoided. Slashing the safety net and eliminat-
ing  all  legal  barriers  to  equality  of  opportunity,  the  Friedmans 
argued, would lead to a more equitable outcome than the social 
democratic approach of monkeying with taxes and subsidies.

Alas,  each  of  these  claims  turned  out  to  be  wrong,  a  fact 
that wouldn’t become clear to (almost) everyone until the Great  
Recession began after 2007.

The story as I have told it so far is one of a social democratic 
system of governance that ran into bad luck in the 1970s. A com-
bination of that bad luck, built-in flaws, and the high expecta-
tions for prosperity that had been set during the Thirty Glorious

Years  caused  it  to  lose  support.  This  gave  right-wingers  their 
opening. But was it really chance and contingency? Or were there 
structural reasons why the social democratic balancing act would 
become increasingly hard to maintain as the societal memory of 
the Great Depression ended and the intensity of the perceived re-
ally-existing socialist threat to the bourgeoisie of the global north 
declined in intensity?

Neoliberal  policies,  once  enacted,  were  no  more  successful 
than social democratic ones had been—save in reducing inflation. 
Rapid growth did not resume. Indeed, median incomes declined 
under  Reagan  and  Thatcher,  as  the  era’s  meager  productivity 
growth was funneled into the pockets of the rich, and a Second 
Gilded Age drew near. By the end of the 1980s, it was clear that 
the neoliberal project of rolling back social democracy had failed 
to surpass the bar of high expectations set by the Thirty Glorious 
Years, just as social democracy itself had failed.

But  the  failure  of  the  neoliberal  project  to  boost  income 
growth in the 1980s did not lead to renewed calls for a further 
revolution  in  policy  and  in  political  economy.  Somehow,  the 
neoliberal  project  became  accepted,  conventional  wisdom—so 
much  so  that  in  the  following  decades  it  gained  support  from 
the center-left. It was not Ronald Reagan, but Bill Clinton, who 
announced, in one of his State of the Union speeches, that “the 
era of big government is over.”20 It was not Margaret Thatcher, 
but Barack Obama, who called for austerity when the unemploy-
ment rate was above 9 percent: “Families across the country are 
tightening their belts and making tough decisions,” he said. “The 
federal government should do the same.”21 It was Bill Clinton 
who made his major social-insurance commitment one to “end 
welfare as we know it.”22 It was Prime Minister Tony Blair, from 
the Labour Party, who validated Margaret Thatcher’s strong al-
lergy  to  British  Labour’s  union-centered  cultural  politics.23  In 
the United States, Democrats and Republicans fenced over what 
form  partial  Social  Security  privatization  would  take—Would

your private plan be an add-on or a carve-out?24 Both sides called 
for the market rather than the government to guide industrial 
development. US public investment fell from 7 percent to 3 per-
cent  of  national  income.  Rather  than  ramping  up  the  govern-
ment role via large-scale increases in R&D funding at the back 
end and guarantees of procurement at the front end, financial de-
regulation was trusted to create venture capital and other pools of 
private investment to fund technological revolutions. Not pollu-
tion-control mandates but, rather, methods of marketing rights 
to pollute. Not welfare programs, but—notionally, as implemen-
tation was always lacking—education programs to eliminate the 
need for welfare. To do more would be to return to outdated so-
cial democratic command-and-control planning initiatives that 
had supposedly demonstrated their failure.

But social democracy had worked in the 1960s and 1970s. 
And—except on the inflation-control front—neoliberalism had 
done no better in the 1980s at generating growth, and a lot worse 
at generating equitable growth, than social democracy had in the 
1970s. What gives?

Centrist and left neoliberals understood themselves as advo-
cates for achieving social democratic ends through more efficient, 
market-oriented  means.  Markets—as  Friedrich  von  Hayek  had 
rightly  stressed  throughout  his  career—crowdsource  the  brain-
storming and then the implementation of solutions that the mar-
ket economy sets itself, and the market economy sets itself the 
task of making things tagged as valuable. Left-neoliberals under-
stood  themselves  as  advocating  for  this  crowdsourcing  and  the 
carrot, where it would be more effective.

Besides, there was still Big Government, even if Bill Clinton 
had thrown rhetorical red-meat to working-class white men who 
felt somehow wounded by inclusion by claiming that Big Gov-
ernment’s era was over. There were powerful government inter-
ventions and policies that appear to have been powerful boosters 
of growth: education (especially female secondary education) in

accelerating  the  demographic  transition;  policies  making  it  easy 
for domestic producers to acquire industrial core technology (em-
bodied  in  capital  goods  or  not);  administrative  simplicity  and 
transparency; transportation and communication infrastructure—
all things that made government effective and that only the gov-
ernment could provide. Relying on the market and right-sizing 
an efficient government could, left-neoliberals hoped, both restore 
rapid economic growth and attract a durable, centrist governing 
coalition. Then attention could be turned to trying to reverse the 
growing  perception  that  treating  people  equally  and  generously 
was not treating people unfairly because it gave to some things 
that they had not merited and did not deserve.

Rightist  neoliberalism  was  much  harder  edged.  A  much 
steeper slope in the distribution of income and wealth was not 
a  bug  but  a  feature.  The  top  0.01  percent—the  job  creators, 
the  entrepreneurs—deserved  to  receive  not  1  percent  but  5 
percent  of  national  income.25  They  deserved  to  have  societal 
power, in the form of the salience given to their preferences in 
the  market’s  semi-utilitarianism,  over  the  direction  of  human 
beings’ time and effort that gave them not 100 to 1,000 times 
but 500 to 250,000 times the national average income.26 And 
to tax them even after they died was not only impolitic but im-
moral: theft. This revived and restored form of pseudo-classical 
semi- liberalism  was  earnestly  supported  by  a  plutocrat-funded 
network of think tanks and “astroturf” interest groups. (“Don’t 
tell me that you are speaking for the people,” I heard Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen once say. “I am old enough to know the 
difference between the grassroots and astroturf.”) This network’s 
central claim was that social democracy was one huge mistake, 
and if only the governments of the world got rid of it, we could 
move swiftly to a utopia. The makers wouldn’t have to carry the 
takers  on  their  backs,  and  the  takers  would  shape  up—and  if 
they did not, they would suffer the consequences, and it would 
serve them right!

That this did not seem to actually work was not much of an 

obstacle to belief.

From  my  perspective,  this  pattern  of  empirical  failure  fol-
lowed by ideological doubling down was reminiscent of what we 
are told of religious politics in the Jerusalem-centered Kingdom 
of Judah late in the First Temple era. The Kingdom of Israel to 
the north had already been conquered by the Assyrians, its cities 
leveled, its elite carried off to subjection in Nineveh. The kings 
of Judah in Jerusalem sought foreign alliances, especially with the 
only other great power in the neighborhood interested in resisting 
Assyria, Egypt. The prophets said: No! Trust not in your own 
swords, and especially not in those of foreign allies who worship 
strange  and  false  Gods!  Trust  in  YHWH!  His  strong  arm  will 
protect  you!  And  when  armies  returned  defeated,  the  prophets 
said: Your problem was that you did not enforce the worship of 
YHWH strongly enough! You allowed women to dance in the 
streets making cakes for the Queen of Heaven! Worship YHWH

And, truth to tell, the neoliberal turn was very successful in 
restoring  the  growth  rate—and  more  than  restore  the  growth 
rate—of the incomes and wealth of those at the top. The rich 
had  the  largest  megaphones,  and  they  trumpeted  the  fact  that 
their incomes were growing rapidly. And those lower down, who 
voted for candidates and politicians who had turned the wheel 
and made the neoliberal turn? They were told that if only they 
were  sufficiently  worthy,  the  unleashed  market  would  give  to 
them too, and they more than half believed it.

THE  ERA  OF  THE  neoliberal  turn  did  deliver  one  thing  out  of 
what its salesmen had promised: it delivered a rapidly rising share 
of the rich in the distribution of national income.

We  already  noted  that  America’s  true  upper  class,  the  top  
0.01  percent  of  households,  went  from  100  to  500  times  the

average in terms of their incomes. The next 0.99 percent, the rest 
of the top 1 percent, went from 8 to 17 times the average. The 
next 4 percent, the rest of the top 5 percent, went from 3.25 to 
4.25 times the average. The next 5 percent, the rest of the top 10 
percent, treaded water in their share of income. And all the niches 
lower down saw their shares of national income fall.

These  are  the  incomes  associated  with  the  ranked  slots  in 
the income distribution, not the incomes of tagged individuals 
or households. And as people age, moreover, their incomes rise. 
And the pie, per capita, was greater in 2010 than it had been in 
1979. In real per capita terms, the measured US income average 
was nearly twice as much in 2010 as it had been in 1979. And a 
great many things of substantial use value were available in 2010 
really cheaply. That mattered. As a general rule, a standard physi-
cal good—a blender, say—sold in the market has an average use-
value  to  consumers  of  perhaps  twice  its  market  value—half  of 
the wealth from production and distribution of a physical good 
comes from the resources, natural and human, used in produc-
tion—that is, its cost of production—and half is consumer sur-
plus, which has to do with how much consumers are willing to 
pay for the product, which is based on getting the good to the 
right user in the right place at the right time. For Information 
Age nonphysical commodities, the ratio may well be greater—
perhaps five to one, maybe more.

Rising  inequality  begs  caveats.  Such  as  that  55  percent  of 
US  households  had  home  air-conditioning  in  1979,  rising  to  
90  percent  by  2010.  Washing  machines  rose  from  70  percent 
to 80 percent, and dryers from 50 percent to 80 percent. Five 
percent  of  US  households  had  microwave  ovens  in  1979,  and  
92 percent had them by 2010. Computers or tablets went from 
0 percent to 70 percent, cellphones to more than 95 percent, and 
smartphones to more than 75 percent.28 The American working 
and middle classes were richer in 2010 than their counterparts 
had been in 1979. In the neoliberal era, the United States was

no longer rapidly increasing the educational level attained by the 
young, no longer aggressively investing in public infrastructure, 
and no longer keeping the government from partially draining 
the pool of savings that would have otherwise flowed to finance 
private  investment.  Productivity  growth  was  only  half  the  rate 
it had been during the Thirty Glorious Years. Equitable growth 
was no longer being delivered. But there was still growth—and 
growth in typical incomes at a pace that came close to matching 
that of 1870–1914, and that people over 1913–1938 would have 
wept to see.

Still, many things that people had taken, and do take, to be 
indicia  of  middle-class  status—of  having  made  it—such  as  an 
easy  commute;  a  detached  house  in  a  good  neighborhood;  the 
ability to get their children into what they think is a good college, 
and then to pay for it; good-enough employer-sponsored health 
insurance that won’t bankrupt them and allow them to lose their 
homes to pay for a heart attack—these seemed more difficult to 
attain  in  the  America  of  2010  than  they  had  been,  at  least  in 
memory, back in 1979. Plus, there was a person’s relative status. 
A successful middle-class American in the age of social democracy 
could  meet  American  Motors  CEO  and  future  Michigan  gov-
ernor  and  Housing  and  Urban  Development  (HUD)  secretary 
George  Romney  and  know  that  he  lived  in  a  normal  house— 
albeit a relatively large one—in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and 
drove a compact car, a Rambler American (admittedly, because 
American Motors made it). A successful middle-class American 
in  the  age  of  neoliberalism  would  meet  Bain  CEO  and  future 
Massachusetts governor and US senator (R-UT) Mitt Romney 
and know that he had seven houses, some of them mansions, scat-
tered around the country and, well, I do not know what models 
of cars he has driven, but I have been told that the house in La 
Jolla, California, near the beach, has a car elevator. Even when 
people  have  more  material  wealth  at  their  disposal  in  absolute

terms than their parents did, a proportional gulf that large that is 
growing that rapidly can make them feel small.

French  economist  Thomas  Piketty  popularized  an  under-
standing  of  the  striking  differences  between  how  the  economy 
had functioned in the global north before World War I and how 
it functioned after World War II.29 In the First Gilded Age, be-
fore World War I, wealth was predominantly inherited, the rich 
dominated  politics,  and  economic  (as  well  as  race  and  gender) 
inequality  were  extreme.  After  the  upheaval  of  World  War  II, 
everything changed. Income growth accelerated, wealth was pre-
dominantly  earned  (justly  or  unjustly),  politics  became  domi-
nated by the middle class, and economic inequality was modest 
(even if race and gender equality remained a long way off). The 
global north seemed to have entered a new era.

And then things shifted back.
Piketty’s central point was that we shouldn’t have been sur-
prised. In a capitalist economy, it is normal for a large propor-
tion of the wealth to be inherited. It is normal for its distribution 
to be highly unequal. It is normal for a plutocratic elite, once 
formed, to use its political power to shape the economy to its 
own advantages. And it is normal for this to put a drag on eco-
nomic growth. Rapid growth like which occurred between 1945 
and 1973, after all, requires creative destruction; and, because it 
is the plutocrats’ wealth that is being destroyed, they are unlikely 
to encourage it.

Why,  then,  did  the  neoliberal  era  last?  It  had  pointed  out 
that social democracy was no longer delivering the rapid progress 
toward utopia that it had delivered in the first post–World War 
II generation. It promised to do better. Yet it did not do better—
save for curbing the union movement in Britain, and providing 
income gains for the rich through tax cuts, as well as through the 
side  effects  of  wage  stagnation,  which  were  truly  staggering  in 
magnitude. Why didn’t discontent with neoliberalism’s failure to

deliver cause another turn of the political-economic societal-or-
ganizational wheel?

I believe it lasted because Ronald Reagan won the Cold War. 
Or, rather, I believe it was because soon after Ronald Reagan’s 
presidency came to an end, the Cold War came to an end, and 
he  was  given  credit  for  it.  And  the  manifest  failure  of  ideas  in 
the shop window of possibilities weren’t uniquely being sold by  
the right.

Looking back from today, or from the 1990s, or even from 
the late 1970s, on the phenomenon of really-existing socialism, 
perhaps  the  most  striking  feature  is  how  inevitable  the  decay  
and decline of the system was. German sociologist Max Weber did 
not have to see what happened from 1917 to 1991 to understand 
how the history of the Bolshevik regime installed by Lenin and his 
comrades was going to go. He looked back before 1917, at previ-
ous history, at episodes in which entrepreneurship and enterprise 
had been replaced with bureaucracy, and he wrote that wherever 
“bureaucracy gained the upper hand, as in China and Egypt, it 
did not disappear”: there was going to be no Marxist “withering 
away,” but rather a hypertrophy of a state issuing commands.

German-Polish activist and moral philosopher Rosa Luxem-
burg, writing in 1918, was even more clear-eyed (and pessimistic):

Without general elections, without unrestricted freedom of 
press  and  assembly,  without  a  free  struggle  of  opinion,  life 
dies out in every public institution. . . . Only the bureaucracy 
remains. . . . A few dozen party leaders of inexhaustible en-
ergy  and  boundless  experience  direct  and  rule. . . . An  elite 
of  the  working  class  is  invited  from  time  to  time  to  meet-
ings where they are to applaud the speeches of the leaders, 
and to approve proposed resolutions unanimously—[it is] at 
bottom, then, a clique affair. . . . Such conditions must inevi-
tably cause a brutalization of public life: attempted assassina-
tions, shooting of hostages, etc.30

The Neoliberal Turn

Both Weber and Luxemburg, however, thought that the bu-
reaucracy  would  be  efficient,  even  if  anti-entrepreneurial.  We-
ber  thought  really-existing  socialism  would  be  regimented  and 
organized. Luxemburg thought it would be brutal and dictatorial. 
Neither predicted the waste, the bread lines, the irrationality of 
economic organization, and the centrality of corruption, influ-
ence, and networks: blat. Neither predicted that when the Iron 
Curtain fell at the end of the 1980s, it would turn out that the 
countries where Stalin’s (or Ho Chi Minh’s, or Kim Il-Sung’s, 
or Fidel Castro’s) armies had marched would be but one-fifth as 
prosperous in material terms as the countries just next door that 
they had not conquered.

Many outside the USSR—for example, the left-wing Marxist 
economist Paul Sweezy—had confidently predicted that Leninist 
socialism  and  government  planning  would  deliver  a  more  effi-
cient allocation of productive forces and a faster rate of economic 
growth than any other possible system. Even many who feared the 
destructive potential of Leninist socialism agreed that the USSR 
and its satellites were likely to forge ahead in total and per capita 
production.  Paul  Samuelson—no  Leninist—wrote  the  leading 
post–World War II American economics textbook. Up until the 
late 1960s, its forecasts showed the USSR economy surpassing 
the US economy in production per head well before 2000. That 
the Soviet Union might produce superior production and equal-
ity, if not prosperity, even if it remained inferior as to freedom 
and choice, seemed a possibility even into the 1960s.

Yet all this turned out to be wrong. The Soviet Union and 
its satellites turned out, when the Iron Curtain fell, to be poor 
indeed. Gross inefficiency in consumer goods allocation turned 
out to be generated by forces that also produced gross inefficiency 
in investment allocation, and so the lands that were to be stud-
ded with automated factories were not. The Soviet Union had 
enjoyed some successes. By 1960, it had by and large attained a 
global-north  level  of  health,  education,  and  life  expectancy.  In

the 1970s it appeared to have a military at least as strong as that 
of  the  United  States—but  it  did  so  by  devoting  40  percent  of 
its national income, rather than the United States’ 8 percent, to 
building it up.

And  the  economic  failures  were  massive.  Increased  output 
was limited, mostly, to steel, machinery, and military equipment. 
The collectivization of agriculture ended in ruin: we do not know 
how  many  died.  We  think  it  was  in  the  mid  seven  figures.  It 
might have been eight figures. And the Soviet growth rate was not 
impressively high when seen in a world context.

The late Yegor Gaidar, a Soviet economist and politician, liked 
to tell the story of the failure of Soviet industrialization through 
the lenses of grain and oil. As he put it, the prominent communist 
economist Nikolay Bukharin and Soviet official Aleksey Rykov 
“essentially told Stalin: ‘In a peasant country, it is impossible to 
extract grain by force. There will be civil war.’ Stalin answered, 
‘I will do it nonetheless.’” As of the 1950s, Nikita Khrushchev 
was dealing with the consequences of the backward, enserfed ag-
ricultural sector Stalin had created. As of 1950, he wrote, “In the 
last fifteen years, we have not increased the collection of grain. 
Meanwhile, we are experiencing a radical increase of urban popu-
lation. How can we resolve this problem?” He ultimately decided 
to throw resources at the problem and undertook large-scale proj-
ects to put more land under grain cultivation. In the end, the plan 
failed. In 1963, the USSR informed its allies that it would no 
longer be able to ship them grain, and then started buying grain 
on the world market.31

It  may  be  that  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  economy  and  the 
Soviet model was delayed for a decade by the more-than-tripling 
of world real oil prices during the OPEC decade of the 1970s. 
According to Gaidar, the beginning of the end came when Saudi 
Arabia decided at the end of 1985 to resume pumping oil at ca-
pacity, and to crash the price of oil, largely to curb the ambitions 
of Iran’s theocrats. This put the Soviet Union in the extremely

difficult position of being unable to earn enough to buy grain to 
feed its massive population. As Gaidar assessed the situation, the 
Soviets were left without any other option and started borrowing 
to cover the difference in 1986. But by 1989, when a Soviet effort 
“to create a consortium of 300 banks to provide a large loan” col-
lapsed, they were forced “to start negotiations directly with West-
ern governments about so-called politically motivated credits.”

That was the ultimate revelation of the industrial bankruptcy 
of the Soviet Union: in a time of low oil prices, the regime could 
only feed its people by bargaining away political concessions in 
return  for  concessionary  loans  with  which  to  purchase  wheat 
from abroad.

Ronald Reagan and his team had decided to amp up the Cold 
War  in  Latin  America  by  hiring  soldiers  from  Argentina’s  fas-
cist dictatorship to be the core cadres of what they hoped would 
become  a  right-wing  guerrilla  insurgency  against  the  left-wing 
“Sandinista” government of Nicaragua. The Argentine generals 
in their junta thought—Did high officials in the Reagan admin-
istration, such as UN Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick, tell them 
so?—that in return the United States would stay neutral if there 
was any conflict between Argentina and Britain over the Falkland 
Islands, which lay three hundred miles off the coast of Argentina, 
and  which  Britain  had  colonized  centuries  before.  So,  seeking 
to boost their domestic political standing via a short, victorious 
war, the Argentine generals conquered the Falklands. Margaret 
Thatcher sent the British navy—with ample American logistical 
support—to retake them. This was the lift beneath her wings to 
win her reelection as prime minister in 1983. Rather than a failed 
four-year experiment, neoliberalism thus cemented the neoliberal 
turn in Britain.

In the United States, the economy came roaring back in time 
to win reelection for Ronald Reagan in 1984—plus, he was su-
perb at being a head-of-state-type president, even if rather bad 
and underqualified as a policy-analyst-type president. His wife,

Nancy, persuaded him to see Mikhail Gorbachev as a potential 
friend in his second term. And it was the end of the Cold War 
that was the wind beneath neoliberalism’s wings in the United 
States.

The hopes and claims at the start of the neoliberal turn in 
1980 had been that the post–World War II golden-age pace of 
economic growth in the global north could be restored by gov-
ernments and societies turning (at least partway) to serve the im-
peratives of the market, rather than the social democratic practice 
of managing, supplementing, and controlling the market econ-
omy. These hopes and claims were dashed. Growth continued, 
but at a much slower pace than during 1938–1973—albeit at a 
slightly faster pace than 1870–1914, and a much faster pace than 
1914–1938.

Distribution  had  shifted.  Inclusion,  especially  for  women, 
but also, to some degree, for minorities, meant that the incomes 
of white men did not keep pace with the average. More import-
ant, however, was that the neoliberal turn accomplished its ex-
plicit goal of transferring income and wealth to the top of the 
distribution. The claim had been that thus incentivizing the rich 
and the superrich would induce them to work harder and unleash 
waves of entrepreneurial energy. That claim proved false. But the 
income and wealth was transferred up nevertheless.

This was disturbing to the established male ethno-majority 
working and middle classes. After 1980 they found the growth 
in  their  real  incomes  to  be  small  and,  in  their  minds,  at  least, 
neutralized by the fact that they no longer received the respect 
from women, minorities, and foreigners—or from the plutocrats 
growing  in  wealth  and  salience  in  their  mental  pictures  of  the 
world—that  was  their  expectation,  and  that  they  saw  as  their 
due. Somehow, things had been rigged against them. The rich 
got richer, the unworthy and minority poor got handouts. Hard-
working white men who deserved more of the good things (ac-
cording to this view) did not get them. Thus a critical mass of

the electorate grew to distrust the system—a system that did not 
seem to be providing them with better lives in the early aughts 
than their predecessors had seen thirty years earlier, and so they 
began to distrust the system’s rulers.

When the Great Recession came along, and when recovery 
from the Great Recession was delayed and hesitant, the govern-
ment  and  the  political  system  barely  seemed  to  care.  A  reason 
was that the rich dominated public discourse. And for the rich, 
there was no crisis. But everyone else—roughly 90 percent of the 
US  population—continued  to  lose  ground.  And  for  them,  the 
economy since 2007 has proved gravely disappointing. They seek 
an explanation, and something to change, and often, someone to 
blame. They are right to do so.

Reglobalization,  

Information Technology,  
and Hyperglobalization

T he  world  began  to  take  the  neoliberal  turn  in  the  1970s. 

The  turn  was  all  but  complete  by  2000.  “Neoliberalism” 
in its various forms had ascended, and was providing the world’s  
political-economy governance default presumptions and practices.
This  ascent  is  a  puzzle.  The  neoliberal  turn  had  failed  to 
deliver higher investment, greater entrepreneurship, faster pro-
ductivity  growth,  or  the  restoration  of  middle-class  wage  and 
income growth. The new policies had delivered massively greater 
income and wealth inequality. What was the appeal? The appeal 
of the neoliberal order hung on because it took credit for victory 
in the Cold War, because it took credit for making sure the un-
deserving didn’t get anything they did not deserve, and because 
the powerful used their megaphones to loudly and repeatedly tell 
others that they deserved the credit for whatever they claimed 
neoliberal policies had achieved. And so the hand that had been 
dealt was played out.

Four  forces  in  particular  led  to  things  playing  out  the  way 
they  did.  The  first  was  post–World  War  II  reglobalization:  the 

461

reversal of the step backward away from the 1870–1914 global-
ization  that  had  taken  place  over  the  period  1914–1950.  The 
second was a big shift in technology: starting in the mid-1950s, 
the steel-box shipping container conquered the world. The third 
was another big shift in technology: the nearly ethereal zeros and 
ones of information technology conquered the world. The fourth 
consisted of the neoliberal policies themselves and how they in-
teracted with the other three. Together these four forces turned 
reglobalization into hyperglobalization.

It should now be obvious that this chapter’s story is not a sim-
ple one. Making it even more complex, the story of reglobaliza-
tion, information technology, and hyperglobalization in the age 
in which the world took the neoliberal turn has two threads. One 
thread follows the consequences of reglobalization, the rise of in-
formation technology, and then hyperglobalization for the global 
south.  The  second  focuses  on  the  consequences  for  the  global 
north. And what bottom lines you ultimately draw—Was it great, 
good, or something else—very much depends on whether your 
patron saint is Hayek or Polanyi.

Global south countries that managed to use neoliberal ideas 
to make their own societies less corrupt (and that escaped being 
hammered by any blowback consequences of neoliberal policies 
in the global north) found themselves able to use, rather than be 
used by, the global world market. For the first time since 1870, 
these economies were no longer forced to diverge from the tra-
jectory of the global north, growing relatively poorer even as they 
grew  absolutely  richer.  From  1990  on,  in  very  broad  strokes, 
the global south began to see real income growth faster than the 
global north.1 And so it looked as if the market’s workings might 
in fact be for the benefit of humankind.

For global-north countries, there were gains from increasing 
world trade and the spread of information technology. But these 
gains wound up concentrated among those at the top of glob-
al-north societies, further enriching the rich. Having a union job

in a factory in the same region as the corporate headquarters no 
longer meant that you got a healthy share of that concentrating 
wealth. Re- and hyperglobalization plus infotech in the context 
of the neoliberal turn meant that bosses and engineers now found 
that they could put their factories elsewhere in the world. The 
greatly  accelerated  flow  of  information  meant  they  no  longer 
needed to drive to the factory to see what was going on, manage 
it, and improve it. Elegies for Polanyian rights were sounded in 
regions of the global north that for the first time experienced the 
deindustrialization that the global south had been experiencing 
since before 1870.

But elegiac hillbillies were just one piece of the global north: 
one  theme  of  squares  in  a  more  complicated  quilted  arrange-
ment.  Infotech’s  realization  of  critical  mass  at  the  start  of  the 
1990s meant that the global north attained productivity growth 
equivalent to that of the Thirty Glorious Years for a decade and a 
half. And while the workings of the Second Gilded Age kept that 
productivity growth from fully trickling down to wages, it also 
meant that the violation of people’s expectations and Polanyian 
rights was likewise quilted—here, but not there, and not in equal 
measure. One result was profound changes in the underpinnings 
of how political economic decisions were made.

As late as 2007, neoliberals at the top were able to congratu-
late themselves, believing that things were going not unreasonably 
well, and that they would continue to go not unreasonably well.2 
Productivity  growth  seemed  back,  and,  they  told  themselves, 
when  the  income  distribution  stabilized,  broad-based  waves  of 
growth would resume and pockets of populist discontent would 
ebb. At the top it looked, again, as if the market’s workings might 
actually be for the benefit of humankind.

But that belief missed much of what was really going on un-
derneath.  After  2007,  the  financial  crisis  and  the  Great  Reces-
sion, subjects a chapter away, were both thoroughgoing disasters 
in their own right. Useful to know for this chapter, however, is

that these disasters would pull back the curtain to reveal that neo-
liberal hubris had truly brought forth nemesis.

POST–WORLD WAR II REGLOBALIZATION was history rhyming 
the post-1870 pattern: the establishment of an international eco-
nomic order under a hegemon plus a transportation technology 
revolution,  once  again  advancing  globalization  at  a  rapid  pace. 
But  after  1870,  Britain-as-hegemon  had  gone  it  alone,  laying 
down a pattern in splendid isolation to which others had to ac-
commodate themselves. The United States after World War II 
built institutions, and so the post–World War II era became a 
great time for new global cooperative organizations. On the po-
litical  side,  of  course,  there  was  the  UN—the  United  Nations 
Organization—with its Security Council, its General Assembly, 
and all of its branches.

On the economic side, there would be three more organiza-
tions. Or at least that was the plan—only two and a half actually 
came into existence. The newly dominant United States wagered 
that international trade would soon become an enabler of both 
international  peace  and  domestic  prosperity.  Western  Europe 
joined in on this wager, most prominently with the creation in 
the mid-1950s of the European Coal and Steel Community for 
free trade in those commodities, an initiative that grew into to-
day’s European Union. And at the 1944 Bretton Woods Con-
ference, Harry Dexter White from the United States and John 
Maynard Keynes from Britain designed a system to try to make 
increased globalization work for good.

The three planned organizations to promote global economic 
cooperation  were  the  World  Bank,  the  International  Mone-
tary  Fund  (IMF),  and—the  one  that  failed  to  fully  come  into 
existence—the  International  Trade  Organization  (ITO).  The 
World Bank began as what was called the International Bank for

Reconstruction and Development and was created for the dual 
purpose of financing reconstruction in the wake of the war’s de-
struction and developing those parts of the world that had not 
yet  grasped  the  productive  opportunities  of  industrial  technol-
ogy. The IMF was created to manage the values of currencies and 
the net flow of financial resources across borders, to enable coun-
tries that needed to reset the terms on which they traded, and to 
coerce certain countries into living up to their economic obliga-
tions. And the planned-for ITO was going to negotiate mutually 
beneficial reductions in tariffs and referee trading disputes.

But while the Truman administration pushed the UN, the 
World Bank, and the IMF through the US Congress, it decided 
at the end of 1950 that ratifying the ITO would be one interna-
tional organization too many. It was, the administration decided, 
too much to ask of Congress. By that time, the tides had shifted 
against the ethos of open-handed international cooperation that 
had dominated in the immediate postwar years; the long twilight 
struggle between the free world and global communism known as 
the Cold War was beginning. The demise of the ITO was a result. 
And so, instead of an organization with teeth intended to enforce 
resolutions to trade disputes, there was to be an agreement—a 
General  Agreement  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  (GATT),  under  the 
aegis of which multiple rounds of multilateral tariff reductions 
would be negotiated over decades. Thus even at the start of this 
reglobalization  push,  there  were  countercurrents,  of  which  this 
was the chief: while the ITO would have required countries and 
sectors and classes to eat whatever the market set before them in 
response to automatic tariff reductions, the GATT required that 
a domestic political coalition be put together in every signatory 
country  before  a  GATT  tariff-reduction  round  could  be  com-
pleted and come into effect.

Such coalitions were put together. Eight rounds of tariff re-
ductions  were  negotiated  and  implemented  between  1947  and

(1950–1951), Geneva II (1956), Geneva III (1962, more com-
monly called the Dillon Round, as it was proposed by C. Doug-
las  Dillon  when  he  was  undersecretary  of  state  for  Republican 
president Eisenhower and concluded by C. Douglas Dillon when 
he  was  secretary  of  the  treasury  for  Democratic  president  Ken-
nedy), the Kennedy (Memorial) Round (1967), the Tokyo Round 
(1979), and the Uruguay Round (1994). By the 1990s each round 
was taking nearly a decade to negotiate, with nearly a decade of 
exhaustion between rounds.

But that was only part of the story. Improvements in domes-
tic production had raced ahead of productivity improvements in 
long-distance transportation from 1914 to 1950. Then the paces 
reversed, with revolutions in ocean transport, the most impressive 
of which was the coming of containerization.3

The cargo container: it is 20 or 40 feet long, 8.5 or 9.5 feet 
high, and 8 feet wide. It carries up to 29 tons in its 2,000 cu-
bic feet of recommended available space—goods worth roughly 
$500,000 (or more) when sold at retail. It can be transported in 
a month anywhere in the world where there are suitable harbors, 
railways, locomotives, flatcars, truck tractors, and roads. It can 
be  moved  carrying  non-fragile,  non-perishable  goods  from  any 
modern factory with a loading dock to any modern warehouse 
anywhere in the world for perhaps 1 percent of the goods’ retail 
value. Before 1960, costs of international transoceanic shipment 
for most commodities could easily amount to 15 percent of retail 
value. Back in the 1950s, the city of San Francisco held 800,000 
people,  and  50,000  of  them  were  longshoremen,  at  least  part 
time. By 1980 there were less than one-fifth as many.

When my family bought a German-made washing machine 
from a warehouse store in San Leandro, California, just on the 
south side of the city of Oakland as we here in Berkeley are on 
the north side, it cost us eight times as much to get the machine

from the warehouse to our basement as it had cost to get it from 
the factory where it was made, in Schorndorf, to the warehouse.
And so reglobalization proceeded during the Thirty Glorious 
Years after World War II. A great deal of the force for expansion 
came from the political-economic side, especially as the United 
States came to see access to its markets as an important tool in 
fighting the Cold War. And then the virtuous trade circle set in: 
rising productivity drove demand for goods ever higher, and so 
expanded capacity was met by expanded demand. By 1975 world 
trade as a share of global economic activity was back to its 1914 
peak of 25 percent—about one-eighth of what a typical region 
spent on goods and services was for imported goods and services, 
and  about  one-eighth  of  a  typical  region’s  earnings  came  from 
exporting goods and services.

This virtuous circle was strongest by far in the global north. 
That  1800–1914  had  concentrated  industry  and  knowledge 
about industry in the global north’s industrial districts had con-
sequences, since ideas creation builds on the ideas stock. Previous 
global-north  industrialization  accelerated  global-north  growth, 
while previous global-south deindustrialization held back glob-
al-south growth. The generation of new ideas, after all, depends 
on the density and magnitude of the stock of already deployed 
ideas in use in the region. The global north’s industrial districts 
thus drove growth forward. This virtuous circle was much less 
evident  in  the  global  south,  which,  remember,  had  been  rela-
tively  deindustrialized  by  the  workings  of  the  earlier  wave  of 
globalization.

Without vibrant manufacturing districts and deep and dense 
communities of engineering practice of its own, how could the 
global south benefit from this reglobalization? The only way was 
by further entrenching itself into its slot in the world division of 
labor. That meant taking advantage of the valuable resources it 
owned, such as minerals and tropical agricultural products, where

relative  prices  continued  to  decline.  And  so,  while  the  global 
south  did  get  richer  during  the  post–World  War  II  decade  of 
reglobalization, it got richer more slowly, and the relative income 
gap continued to grow up to at least 1990.

In the first post–World War II generation, in a nutshell, you 
could understand who benefited from reglobalization by talking 
of the “frown curve.” At the start, the left side, the frown curve 
is low: there is relatively little wealth to be gained by providing 
raw materials, as elastic supply and inelastic demand means that 
primary-product producers, who as a group work hard to increase 
their productivity, can do little more than to reduce the prices 
at which they can sell as productivity increases; and thus there is 
relatively little wealth to be gained in design, as competitors can 
quickly reverse-engineer something that’s already in existence and 
visible. There is, however, a great deal of wealth to be gained in 
the middle, where the frown curve is high. There, the know-how 
and the know-what of the industrial districts of the global north 
brought about the enormous efficiencies of mid- and late-1900s 
mass production. And there is relatively little wealth to be gained 
at the end, the right side, where the frown curve is once again 
low: marketing and distribution—matching commodities to the 
particular needs of individuals, or at least convincing individuals 
it is worth paying you to do so—is also not where the bulk of the 
action is.

But  the  story  of  reglobalization  via  political  economy  and 
containerization is only the first third of the story of this chapter. 
In the 1980s there was another huge technological shift gather-
ing  force  that  would  have  powerful  influences  on  world  trade 
and far beyond: information technology. There came a true rev-
olution in the cost of transporting not goods but bits, not mate-
rial objects but information. The communication and data global 
Internet—and the massive fiberoptic submarine and subsurface 
cables, plus the narrowcast and broadcast transmitters, receivers,

and  satellites  on  which  it  rides—transformed  the  world  again 
starting in the 1990s.

I HAVE NOT WRITTEN much in this book about precisely how 
new  technologies  have  advanced  human  collective  powers  over 
nature, about how they allowed us to organize ourselves in new 
ways, and what they were and did. I have simply written about 
their rate of growth: for example, the 2 percent per year in ideas 
growth after 1870. To have focused on what they were and what 
they did would have been a very different book, one that needs 
more of an engineer and less of a political economist. Let me has-
ten to add that that different book, competently executed, would 
be a great book about things of vital, perhaps overwhelming, im-
portance. My late teacher David Landes’s Unbound Prometheus 
accomplished  this  task  for  Europe  from  1750  to  1965,  and  it 
remains a classic. And Robert Gordon has written a new classic 
covering the United States since 1870 in the same vein.4

But right here and now it is, I think, appropriate to bring some 
features of these technologies to center stage. Consider the idea of 
General Purpose Technologies (GPTs): those technologies where 
advances  change,  if  not  everything,  nearly  everything,  as  they 
ramify across sector upon sector.5 Steampower in the early 1800s 
was  the  first.  Early  machine  tools—embodying  in  their  design 
and construction so much technological knowledge about how to 
shape materials—in the mid-1800s were the second. Then after 
1870 came telecommunications, materials science, organic chem-
istry, internal combustion engines, the assembly line, subsequent 
machine-tool generations, and electricity—the technologies the 
flowering  of  which  make  up  Robert  Gordon’s  “one  big  wave” 
of technological advance, and which he sees as transforming the 
global north over the period 1870–1980 and then ebbing. Start-
ing in the 1950s and reaching critical mass in the 1990s, there

came another GPT: microelectronics. Electrons were now made 
to dance not in the service of providing power but rather to assist 
and amplify calculation—and communication. And it turned out 
that  microelectronics  as  microcontrollers  could  allow  the  con-
struction of materials that could perform much better and that 
were cheaper and lighter than relying on dumb matter arranged 
in ways that linked mechanically.6

Take  the  quartz  components  of  common  sand.  Purify  and 
liquefy them by heating them to more than 1,700°C (3,100°F). 
Add carbon to pull the oxygen atoms out of the quartz, leaving 
behind pure molten liquid silicon. Cool the silicon, and, just be-
fore it solidifies, drop a small seed crystal into it. Then pull up 
the seed crystal and the surrounding silicon attaching itself to it.
If you have done this right, you will then have a monocrys-
talline  silicon  cylinder.  Slice  it  finely  and  thinly  into  “wafers.” 
These  wafers  of  pure  silicon  crystal  do  not  conduct  electricity. 
Why not? Because of a silicon atom’s fourteen electrons, ten can-
not move to become currents because they are locked to the nu-
cleus in what chemists call their 1s and 2sp “orbitals.” (“Orbital” 
is a misnomer: they do not really “orbit.” Niels Bohr a century 
and  more  ago  thought  they  did,  but  he  did  not  have  it  right. 
Erwin Schrödinger put him straight.) Only the outermost four 
electrons, in the 3sp orbitals, might ever get energized and then 
move around to become electric currents. But in pure silicon they 
cannot ever do so, because they are locked between their atom’s 
nucleus and the nuclei of its four neighbors in the crystal. Enough 
energy to knock them out of the 3sp orbitals and into the “con-
duction band” orbitals would break the crystal.

But suppose you were to replace a few of the silicon atoms in 
the crystal—1 in every 10,000 atoms is more than enough—with 
phosphorus atoms, which have not fourteen but fifteen electrons 
each. Fourteen of each phosphorus atom’s electrons will act like 
the silicon atom’s electrons: locked into place, tightly bound in 
their 1s and 2sp orbitals to their home nucleus, and the outer

four bound in their 3sp orbital to both their home nucleus and 
to the four neighboring nuclei. But the fifteenth electron can-
not fit. It finds a higher energy orbital state, in which it is only 
loosely bound to any one nucleus. It can and does move about 
in response to small gradients in the local electric field. And so 
the  region  of  your  silicon  crystal  that  you  have  “doped”  with 
phosphorus becomes a conductor of electricity. But if you were 
to  do  something  that  pulled  those  fifteenth  electrons  away  to 
someplace else, that region would then also become a noncon-
ductive insulator like the rest of the crystal. A doped region of 
a silicon crystal is thus like the on-off switch on your wall that 
controls your ceiling light. By applying or removing small volt-
ages of electrical current and electromagnetic pressure, we can 
flip that switch on and off as we choose, and so let the current 
flow or not as we choose.

Right now, in the semiconductor fabricators of the Taiwan 
Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  (TSMC),  the  ma-
chines  that  it  has  bought  (from  ASML  Holdings  in  the  Neth-
erlands  and  Applied  Materials  in  Silicon  Valley)  and  installed 
and programmed are carving 13 billion such semiconductor sol-
id-state switches with attached current and control paths onto a 
piece of a wafer that will become a crystal silicon “chip” about 
two-fifths of an inch wide and two-fifths of an inch tall. TSMC’s 
marketing materials imply that the smallest of the carved features 
is only twenty-five silicon atoms wide. (In actual fact, the features 
are more like ten times that size.) If the 13 billion component 
switches of this small chip of crystal rock made from sand were 
carved correctly, and it passes its tests, which require that its cur-
rent  pathways  switch  on  and  off  accurately  and  synchronously 
3.2  billion  times  a  second,  the  chip  will  wind  up  at  the  heart 
of a machine like the one connected to the keyboard on which 
were typed these words. It will be an Apple M1 microprocessor, 
a very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit made up of these tiny 
switches of doped silicon crystal, which we call transistors.

William  Shockley,  John  Bardeen,  and  Walter  Brattain  are 
the three credited with building the first transistor at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories in 1947. Dawon Khang and Mohamed Attila  
are credited with building the first metal-oxide semiconductor 
field effect transistor. Jay Last’s group, building on the ideas of 
Robert  Noyce  and  Jean  Hoerni  of  Fairchild  Semiconductor, 
built the first operational solid-state integrated circuit made up 
of more than one transistor. By 1964 General Microelectronics 
was making and selling a 120-transistor integrated circuit. Pre-
vious vacuum-tube electronic switching elements were 4 inches 
long—100  millimeters.  Transistors  in  1964  were  packed  one-
twenty-fifth of an inch, 1 millimeter apart: they were 100 times 
smaller, enabling 10,000 times as much computation power to 
be  packed  into  the  same  space,  with  orders  of  magnitude  less 
power consumption.

Gordon  Moore,  then  also  working  at  Fairchild  Semi-
conductor, observed in 1965 that the number of solid-state mi-
croelectronic transistors in frontier integrated circuits had grown 
from  1  to  100  in  the  seven  years  since  1958.  He  made  a  bold 
and highly speculative prediction that we could look forward to 
a future of “component-crammed equipment,” projecting that in 
1975, which was just ten years away, a 100 square millimeter sil-
icon chip would hold 65,000 components. That would allow for 
“electronic techniques more generally available throughout all of 
society,  performing  many  functions  that  presently  are  done  in-
adequately by other techniques or not done at all,” he said. He 
predicted “home computers—or at least terminals connected to 
a central computer, automatic controls for automobiles, and per-
sonal portable communications.” He said there would be “inte-
grated circuits in digital filters [to] separate channels on multiplex 
equipment,” and forecast advances in telephone circuits and data 
processing. “Computers will be more powerful, and will be orga-
nized in completely different ways,” he concluded.7

By  1971,  integrated-circuit  semiconductor  fabricators  had 
taken four steps downward to a finer process for inscribing pat-
terns  on  the  crystal.  The  first  microprocessor,  the  Intel  4004, 
packed  20,000  transistors  into  a  square  millimeter—features 
were 200 microns, 200 millionths of a meter, apart. By 2016 the 
feature-plus-separation  distance  was  down  to  200  nanometers, 
200 billionths of a meter. (And by 2021, there would be a fur-
ther shrinkage, by more than half, and the feature-plus-separation 
distances  would  be  only  90  nanometers—450  silicon  atoms—
across). Back in 1979, to execute 1 MIPS—a million instructions 
per second—required 1 watt of power. By 2015, 1 watt could 
drive more than 1 million MIPS. As components became smaller, 
they became faster. Halve the size of the feature, and you can run 
it twice as fast—up to a point. Before 1986, microprocessor speed 
quadrupled every seven years. Then, with the coming of the sim-
plicity of reduced instruction sets, came seventeen years in which 
each  quadrupling  of  speed  took  three  years  rather  than  seven. 
Then, after 2003, the quadrupling time went back to seven years, 
until further speed improvements hit a wall in around 2013.

But the packing of more and more smaller and smaller transis-
tors into VLSI chips continued through what I can only call Deep 
Magic, albeit at a slower pace than with the original “Moore’s 
Law.” I can read that the ASML TWINSCAN NXE:3400C ma-
chine  uses  extreme  ultraviolet  light  with  a  wavelength  of  13.5 
nanometers, and think: that machine is keeping itself aligned and 
carving 20 million lines with its lasers into the silicon crystal of 
a 300 millimeter (12-inch) wafer without erring in positioning 
any one of those lines by as much as one-thirty-thousandth of 
a  human  hair.  And  I  cannot  grasp  how  this  could  possibly  be 
done, regularly and reliably, for a variable cost of only $50 per 
microprocessor.8

At  its  most  rapid  pace  during  the  information-technology 
revolution, the company at the heart of the innovation economy,

microprocessor  designer  and  manufacturer  Intel,  was  tick- 
tocking—tick,  improving  the  microarchitectural  details  of  its 
micro processors, so programs could run faster; tock, improving 
the fine resolution of its manufacturing, so that it could make 
the  features,  and  thus  the  entire  microprocessor,  smaller—and 
completing a full cycle in under three years. With microproces-
sors doubling in speed every two years, and with the information- 
technology sector taking full advantage, measured economy-wide 
productivity growth after 1995 rose again—coming close to its 
golden-age immediate post–World War II pace—until the Great 
Recession disruption came at the end of 2007. The wealth cre-
ated was spread widely and diffused among users, who gained re-
markable capabilities to learn, communicate, and be entertained 
at an astonishingly low price, and the technoprinces of Silicon 
Valley and those who assisted them. There were economic dis-
ruptions: losers. There were half a million women in the United 
States staffing telephone switchboards in phone companies and at 
reception desks in 1960. There are less than two thousand today. 
But, for the most part, and on the domestic level, the coming of 
information  technology  to  critical  mass  changed  the  tasks  that 
had to be done in order to make up the occupation, rather than 
destroying occupations themselves.

As infotech spread through the economy, the nature of work 
changed. We East African Plains Apes have long had strong backs 
and thighs with which to move heavy objects, nimble fingers to 
do fine work, mouths and ears with which to communicate, and 
brains with which to think, and manipulate symbols. Starting with 
the  domestication  of  the  horse  and  continuing  with  the  steam 
engine, the place of backs and thighs in human work had been 
greatly reduced by 1870, but there was still plenty of fine manip-
ulation to do. With the coming of electricity and its machinery, 
human fingers began to be replaced by machines also, but there 
was still a huge amount of complex design to be done, along with 
brainstorming  and  routine  accounting  and  informing,  all  work

to be done by brains, mouths, and ears. Every machine required 
a microcontroller, and the human brain was by far the best one 
available.  So  technology  had  so  far  complemented  labor  rather 
than  substituting  for  it:  more  machines  and  more  information 
technology made human beings more valuable and more produc-
tive, rather than less so. But to many, the new work seemed less 
like the type of thing that a high-status master craftsman might do 
and more like the tasks required of a servant—either of the cus-
tomer, or of the increasingly autonomous-looking machine itself.
On the international scale, information technology plus on-
going reglobalization turned, in the 1990s when infotech reached 
critical mass, into hyperglobalization.9

The international economist Richard Baldwin put his finger 
on the pulse of what he calls the “second unbundling”: that of in-
tra-firm communication. With the coming of the Internet, it was 
no longer necessary for a firm’s sophisticated industrial division 
of labor to be geographically concentrated. You no longer had to 
be able to walk or drive to your supplier’s offices and factories to 
show them how what they had was not quite what you needed. 
You  could,  first,  in  the  1980s,  draw  a  picture  and  send  a  fax. 
Then, in the 1990s, you could send an email. By the late 2000s 
you could send multi-megabyte data files around the globe.

And  for  those—many—cases  in  which  words-on-paper  or 
words-and-pictures-on-screen were not enough? After 1990, in-
creasingly,  you  could  hop  onto  an  overnight  transoceanic  non-
stop  jet.  The  word  is  that  Apple  Computer  had  fifty  first-class 
seats a day back and forth between San Francisco and China in 
the  months  before  the  coming  of  the  COVID-19  plague.  And 
for those cases in which the limits of the division of labor were 
not so much the communication of knowledge but the face-to-
face, looking-in-the-eye establishment of trust and its limits? The 
transoceanic airplane flight worked there as well.

Thus,  after  1990,  manufacturing,  which  had  been  increas-
ingly concentrating itself in the global north since 1800, began to

spread out away from the global north at tremendous speed. Not 
just  better—but  revolutionarily  and  superlatively  better—com-
munications  made  it  possible  to  spread  out  what  had  been  re-
gional concentrations of firms into globe-spanning value chains. 
The extraordinary wage gaps that a century of economic diver-
gence had created between global north and global south made 
all of this immensely profitable. In the space of a generation, with 
the spreading-out of production into globe-spanning value-chain 
networks, much of global manufacturing became both high tech 
and low wage.

As Baldwin put it, the logic of global production after 1990 
was  increasingly  driven  by  the  smile  curve:  low  in  the  middle, 
high at the beginning and the end. Great value was earned at the 
beginning by providing raw materials and resources and, more 
important, industrial design. Little value was added in the mid-
dle by increasingly routinized manufacturing and assembly. And 
great value was added at the end by marketing, branding, and dis-
tribution—providing information (and misinformation) to con-
sumers about what they might want from the enormous variety of 
types and qualities of goods that could be churned out from the 
expanding capacity of factories. And it was, again, a quilt. Very 
good  things  happened  in  selected  places.  Other  places,  nearby 
in culture, political allegiances, and attitudes, got left behind— 
either their industries that they drew on for relatively high-value 
and high-income niches in the world’s division of good things 
packed up and moved away, or they never arrived.

Although I have said that this “second unbundling” process 
transferred manufacturing to the global south, that is not quite 
right. High-tech global manufacturing went to Korea, so much 
so that Korea is now a full member of the global north, alongside 
Japan, as well as Taiwan. It went, above all, to parts of China—
but specifically to the growth-pole megacities of the Pearl River 
Delta, Shanghai, and Beijing, and secondarily to the coasts, but

not to the interior. It also went to India—but overwhelmingly 
to Maharashtra and Karnataka, not to Uttar Pradesh. It went to 
Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, and is now going to Vietnam. 
It went to Poland, next door to the manufacturing powerhouse of 
Germany, whose firms found enormous benefits in spreading out 
their value chains to make use of the low-wage labor found next 
door. It went to Mexico, but much less so than those of us who 
had high hopes for the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) in the early 1990s expected. Elsewhere? By and large, 
not. It is a quilt. The opportunity to grasp a substantial place in 
global value-chain production networks opened only to a few in 
the global south. Firms had to invite local producers to join their 
value networks. And while knowledge can be broadcast via the 
Internet, trust still requires face-to-face interaction. It may have 
been  the  transoceanic  nonstop  jet  flight  and  the  international  
hotel chains that were the key link in this second unbundling.

The ongoing contests over who would benefit and how much 
produced enormous gains for the world. More than 80 percent of 
the world’s population lived on less than US$2 per day in 1870. 
That fraction was down to 72 percent by 1914, 64 percent by 
1950, and 40 percent by 1984. That extreme fraction was down 
to 9 percent by 2010—in large part because of the spillovers from 
hyperglobalization.

But half the world’s population still lived on less than US$6 
per day. It was not the case that the whole world was flat. Lack 
the necessary infrastructure for containers, transport vehicles, and 
forklifts, and you were still far away from the global trading sys-
tem  that  carried  high-end  German  manufactured  washing  ma-
chines  from  Westphalian  factories  to  California  warehouses  for 
just a penny a pound, and far from the global trade network. If 
your electricity is unreliable, so that you can’t count on being able 
to pump diesel into a truck tractor; if the volume of your pro-
duction is too small to fill 2,000 cubic feet of space; if the money

to fix your roads was embezzled; if your courts function so badly 
that few outsiders are confident that what you say is theirs really is 
theirs; if nobody has yet noticed what your workers can produce; 
if your entrepreneurs cannot build organizations at container-scale 
without attracting politically well-connected extortionists—then 
you are not attached to the network. Attaching to the global trade 
network is an immense opportunity, but it requires that every-
thing, or nearly everything—infrastructure, scale, public admin-
istration, governance, and foreign knowledge of your production 
capabilities—be working just right. And to fully participate in hy-
perglobalization, a region needs the international airline connec-
tions and the hotels required by the firms that orchestrate globally 
distributed value chains to incorporate them.

Still, by 2010 the world’s deployed technological capability 
stood at more than twenty times what it had been in 1870, and 
more than twice what it had been in 1975. Yes, the population 
explosion had continued—the world was on a track that could 
lead to a stable population of between nine and ten billion after 
2050—but in many places the forces slowing population growth 
were  not  yet  that  visible.  And,  yes,  the  population  explosion 
meant that resources were scarce: thus average productivity was 
not twenty but nine times what it had been in 1870. And, yes, 
the creation had been accompanied by a lot of creative destruc-
tion, and many people felt that the market had taken away from 
them, or that it had not given them their fair share, while giving 
an overabundance, in undeserved measure, to others.

THIS  LAST,  ESPECIALLY.  WHILE  hyperglobalization  may  have 
meant  the  arrival  of  much  manufacturing  production  in  parts 
of the global south, it also meant the departure of a large share 
of  manufacturing  production  from  the  global  north.  This  did 
not  mean  that  manufacturing  production  in  the  global  north

fell—with total production increasing, a smaller share of the total 
was still a larger absolute amount. It did mean that the share of 
jobs  in  manufacturing  in  the  global  north  declined—relatively 
slowly at first, but more precipitously as the end of the twentieth 
century neared.

In the decades after 1970, it was primarily the so-called less-
skilled manufacturing jobs that decreased as a share of employ-
ment  in  the  global  north.  Along  with  this  shrinkage,  general 
demand for lesser-skilled workers—well proxied as those without 
college educations—also decreased. This drop in demand mani-
fested differently in different parts of the global north. In West-
ern Europe, it showed up as a rise in unemployment (especially 
among men), while in the United States it manifested as falling 
real wages for “lesser-skilled” workers (again, especially men).

Both the left and the right reacted to these developments by 
claiming they were primarily the result of hyperglobalization—
especially  increasing  imports  from  developing  economies.  And 
yet  that  could  not  have  been  the  case.  Consider,  for  example, 
the United States over the years from 1970 to 1990, when the 
argument that imports were costing Americans good jobs first be-
came influential. Over the course of those two decades, imports 
increased from about 6 percent of GDP to 12 percent. But the 
relative average wage of a country selling imports to the United 
States rose from 60 percent to 80 percent of the US level. Each 
typical import, therefore, came from a country where the relative 
income  gap  was  only  half  as  large,  and  so  the  pressure  put  on 
America by the fact that imports came from countries with lower 
wages remained about the same.

Individual  regions’  employment  levels  were  decimated  by 
competition from elsewhere, yes. But that had always been the 
case since 1870, and before—it was the creative destruction of 
the growing market economy at work. Those in the crosshairs of 
“the market taketh away” regarded this instability as a violation

of their Polanyian rights. But for losers there were gainers, and—
at least before 1980—this did not bring about any pronounced 
class skew within the global north.

Consider  the  career  of  my  grandfather,  William  Walcott 
Lord, who was born in New England early in the twentieth cen-
tury. When the Lord Brothers Leather Company, in Brockton, 
Massachusetts,  faced  imminent  bankruptcy  during  the  Great 
Depression in 1933, he and his brothers relocated to South Paris, 
Maine, where wages were lower. The Brockton workers were out 
of a job and had few prospects for finding a new one, given the 
widespread destruction of relatively high-paying blue-collar fac-
tory jobs across southern New England. But in the aggregate sta-
tistics, their loss was offset by a bonanza for the rural workers 
of South Paris, who went from slaving away in near-subsistence 
agriculture  to  holding  seemingly  steady  jobs  in  a  shoe  factory 
(until that shoe factory became uneconomic to run in 1946, with 
competition from the Carolinas and the end of the World War 
II boom).

We tend to think of the post–World War II period as a time 
of relative stability, but in fact large numbers of manufacturing 
and construction jobs were churning in this way—not disappear-
ing, but moving en masse from one region to another. In 1943, 
38 percent of the US nonfarm labor force was in manufacturing, 
owing to high demand for bombs and tanks at the time. After 
the war, that number decreased to around 30 percent. Had the 
United States been a normal postwar industrial powerhouse like 
Germany or Japan, technological innovation would have contin-
ued to bring it down over the course of 1950–1990 to around 17 
percent as of 1990. But Ronald Reagan’s decision to run big bud-
get deficits and turn the United States from a country that saved 
more than it invested to one that invested more than it saved led 
it to decline even further, down to 13 percent as of 1990.

Then, in the final part of the long twentieth century, from 
1990 to 2010, the relative wage of the country from which the

average  non-oil  import  came  to  the  United  States  fell  sharply. 
This  was  driven  largely  by  China,  which  was  contributing  an 
ever larger share of manufactured imports even as its wages re-
mained extremely low. Yet the pace of decline in US manufac-
turing  employment  did  not  accelerate.  And  the  share  of  jobs 
that  were  regarded  as  suitable  for  blue-collar  men—in  manu-
facturing,  construction,  distribution,  and  transportation—held 
steady. American consumers bought Chinese manufactures, and 
an assembly-line job that had been in Dayton, Ohio, moved to 
Shenzhen.  But  there  were  distribution  jobs  moving  the  goods 
from Long Beach to their final destination. And dollars earned 
by Chinese manufacturers were recycled through China’s finan-
cial system and invested in the United States, where they funded 
housing  construction.  Blue-collar  manufacturing  assembly-line 
jobs  shrank  in  relative  numbers.  Blue-collar  distribution  and 
blue-collar construction jobs rose in relative numbers.

Meanwhile,  rapidly  increasing  manufacturing  productivity 
and incompetent macroeconomic management drove the blue- 
collar job share down even further. Hyperglobalization’s princi-
pal effect was to cause not a decline in blue-collar jobs but a roll 
of the wheel from one type of blue-collar job to another—from 
assembly-line  production  to  truck-driving  and  pallet- moving 
distribution, plus, for a while, construction. And yet it was hy-
perglobalization  that  entered  the  public  sphere  as  the  princi-
pal cause of blue-collar economic distress in the world’s richest 
economies.

Why is this?
Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik has observed that 
as trade barriers decline, the benefits of increased trade diminish: 
that  is,  more  and  more  trade  is  required  to  generate  a  smaller 
and  smaller  reward  for  participants.  The  volume  of  trade  thus 
becomes very large relative to the net gains—and as jobs move at 
a faster pace, even if they’re being replaced, there’s still a greater 
number of people caught up in the churn. It’s not hard to see

why they might blame globalization for their plight. Moreover, 
some  demographic  groups  have  been  particularly  susceptible. 
The shift in US employment from assembly-line manufacturing 
to  construction,  services,  and  caretaking  had  very  little  impact 
on the overall distribution of income. But it did have a large ef-
fect on the distribution by gender: the jobs closing down were 
overwhelmingly  male  jobs,  and  those  opening  up  were  not. 
Moreover, the jobs that were closing down—whether by trade, 
technology, regional shift, or otherwise—were those that had his-
torically been good paths to upward mobility for those with less 
education,  paths  from  which  minorities,  especially  Blacks,  had 
been excluded by segregation before. To those groups whose jobs 
were closing down or who were seeing gates slam shut for paths 
that previous generations had used for upward mobility, it’s no 
wonder that globalization seemed like a plausible explanation for 
their misfortune.10

Furthermore,  China’s  economic  rise  coincided  with  a  pe-
riod when the United States and other industrialized countries 
were struggling to reach full employment. Successful economic 
readjustments  do  not  happen  when  bankruptcies  force  labor 
and capital out of low-productivity, low-demand industries, but 
rather when booms pull labor and capital into high- productivity, 
high-demand  industries.  That  the  “China  shock”  hit  a  shaky 
economy made it much more likely that it would be substantially 
destructive.

So if hyperglobalization has not impoverished the workers of 
major industrial economies, what has it done? The question can 
be  sharpened  by  thinking  back  to  the  pre–World  War  I  Belle 
Époque.  In  pre–World  War  I  Britain,  industry  after  industry 
saw its share of exports decline as competition from German and 
American producers picked up. My wheat-farming great grand-
parents in Illinois, whose prices hinged on European demand for 
grain, would have been astonished to have been told that they 
were not part of an integrated economy.

So what is the difference? Are financial flows stronger or more 
important today? Probably not. Is trade stronger and more im-
portant? Maybe: world trade as a share of world product is a bit 
larger. But the net embodied factor content of trade as a share 
of world product appears smaller, and that is presumably what 
matters most for trade’s effect on, say, unskilled workers’ wages. 
Trade is just swapping: what you had produced before at home 
you  now  import,  and  you  pay  for  it  by  producing  something 
else. Trade affects wages because that shift in production from 
“what you had produced before” to the “something else” changes 
the  supply-and-demand  balance  for  different  kinds  of  workers 
with different skills. But if the workers who had produced the 
“what . . . before” have the same skills as the workers who now 
produce the “something else,” it is hard to see where a big effect 
on average wages could come from.

Has international labor migration become a more import-
ant factor? Certainly not: between 1850 and 1920, one in every 
ten people in the world moved from one continent to another. 
Post–World War II, post-1973, or even post-1990 world popu-
lation flows are a far smaller share of world population than in 
the old days.

So what is different? Why did “globalization” become such a 
powerful red cape to elicit rage at the end of the long twentieth 
century?

One possibility that I favor: back before the Belle Époque, 
what  you  could  transfer  across  national  boundaries  was  pretty 
much  limited  to  commodities  and  securities.  You  could  really 
only transfer something if you could pack it in a crate or an en-
velope  and  send  it  across  the  sea  (or  over  the  telegraph  lines). 
International transactions that required more in the form of cross- 
border linkages were very hard to accomplish. Think of the Ford 
Motor Company’s early post–World War I attempts to transfer 
its assembly-line productivity to Britain; of British and Japanese 
attempts  to  use  Lancashire-manufactured  textile  machinery  to

achieve  high  productivity  in  factories  in  India  or  China;  or  of 
the frantic attempts of British investors—who had never imag-
ined how easily Jay Gould would be able to buy the courts of 
New  York—to  extract  bond  coupons  and  dividends  from  the 
Erie Railroad that their debenture and share certificates said they 
“owned.”  Goods  and  payments  flowed  across  borders.  Control 
was exercised within countries by countries’ own nationals.

But in hyperglobalization, the breadth of cross-national links, 
especially people in other countries controlling what goes on in 
yours, has vastly increased. Back then you could not effectively 
exercise corporate control across national borders. Now you can. 
Back then you could not transfer forms of organization to achieve 
home-country  productivity  in  foreign  production  operations. 
Now you can. Back then you could not integrate design and spec-
ification in one country with production in another. Now you 
can. In this environment, transnational or multinational corpo-
rations are going to be a good candidate for someone to blame.

And with the coming of the Great Recession after 2007, there 

was going to be a great deal of demand for somebody to blame.

Great Recession  

and Anemic Recovery

A s of the spring of 2007, the well-thinking, at least in the 

United  States,  did  not  recognize  that  the  long  twentieth 
century of American exceptionalism—indeed, of North Atlantic 
dominance—was already over.

The  heart  of  the  innovation  economy,  microprocessor  de-
signer  and  manufacturer  Intel,  was  still  tick-tocking,  with  the 
microprocessors at the heart of the information sector doubling 
in  speed  and  computational  power  every  three  years,  and  with 
the information-technology sector taking full advantage of that. 
Measured  economy-wide  productivity  growth  over  the  preced-
ing decade was close to its golden-age post–World War II pace.1 
Inflation high enough and recessions deep enough to be major 
disturbances  had  last  been  seen  twenty-five  years  ago:  this  was 
the “Great Moderation” of the business cycle.2 Plus the neoliberal 
turn appeared to have delivered benefits in the global south: its 
growth had been the fastest ever.

Yes, there had been a generation of rapidly growing income 
and  wealth  inequality.  But  voters  did  not  seem  to  care  much. 
Tax cuts, the lion’s share of which went to the rich, were enacted

more often than reversed. Center-left parties believed they had 
to  make  concessions  to  the  right  to  be  electorally  competitive. 
Right-wing parties by and large did not feel they had to make 
concessions to the left. Unhappiness with the neoliberal turn was 
not showing itself in solid, long-lasting majorities for parties that 
wanted to soften—let alone possibly reverse—at least parts of it. 
And center-left parties in the North Atlantic remained conflicted: 
ideas and interests both sang the sirens’ song that left-neoliberal-
ism might work, that market mechanisms might be used to attain 
social democratic ends, and that a reinvigorated economic growth 
rate  would  make  the  political  lift  to  reverse  the  coming  of  the 
Second Gilded Age easier.

The well-thinking should have known better. The deep struc-
tural  supports  were  breaking.  In  1993,  then  US  congressman 
Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and press lord Rupert Murdoch had be-
gun the process of constructing, around the globe, via direct-mail, 
cable television, and eventually Internet, an easily grifted right-
wing base that would freely open their pocketbooks because they 
were  easily  convinced  that  center-left  political  adversaries  were 
not just wrong but evil and immoral—running pedophile rings 
out  of  pizza  parlors.3  The  center-left  kept  hoping  for  political  
detente: its leaders kept saying that they saw not red (right wing) 
and blue (left wing), but purple.4 But the right said nope: were 
they to dial down the urgency, the base’s eyeballs would no lon-
ger be so glued to their screens for the selling of ads, and their 
pocketbooks would no longer be so open.

In 2003, the era in which the United States was the trusted 
leader of the global-north “Western alliance” came to an end. At 
the end of the 1980s, after the end of the Cold War, the George 
H.W. Bush administration had reassured the nations of the world 
that US military supremacy was benign, because the US military 
would be deployed only in support of an overwhelming majority 
vote of a country’s people, or according to the will of the UN 
Security Council. The Clinton administration had changed this

to “according to the will of the NATO alliance”; and then the 
George W. Bush administration had changed it to “more or less 
at random, according to false and misleadingly interpreted intel-
ligence, against countries that do not possess nuclear weapons.” 
Countries took note.

In 2007 the era in which high-tech advances gave measured 
global-north  productivity  growth  a  materially  significant  boost 
was at an end. The tick-tock ran into a so-far insuperable tech-
nological barrier: before 2007, shrink a component to half its size 
and you could run it twice as fast without generating too much 
heat to be dissipated; after 2007, this “Dennard scaling” began 
to break down because of increased current leakages at extremely 
small sizes.

Moreover, the focus shifted from providing information to 
capturing attention—and capturing attention in ways that played 
on  human  psychological  weaknesses  and  biases.  The  commod-
ity-economy market had served the interests of the rich and so 
raised their utility, a goal that at least a utilitarian philosopher 
could approve. The attention-economy market threatened simply 
to grab their attention in ways that might or might not raise even 
their utility.

Plus, there had been a sequence of financial crises—Mexico in 
1994, East Asia in 1997–1998, Argentina in 1998–2002—that 
had not been handled well, either in the run-up or the workout. 
Japan had been mired in, if not depression, at least stagnation, 
with inadequate total spending for fifteen years. Yet among policy 
makers the dominant feeling was that financial regulation should 
not be tightened to guard against overleverage, and against bub-
bles that might threaten to cause crisis and depression, but rather 
loosened.  The  Clinton  administration  had  refused  to  regulate 
derivative  markets  when  they  were  small,  on  the  grounds  that 
business-model and asset-type experimentation was needed in fi-
nance, in order to figure out ways to make investors as a group 
more comfortable with their risk-bearing role.

When derivative markets became large and incomprehensi-
ble in the 2000s, the George W. Bush administration doubled 
down on deregulation. And the Federal Reserve—with the hon-
orable exception of the wise Board of Governors member Ned 
Gramlich—agreed. The Fed, after all, had stopped any serious 
depression from happening after the stock market crash of 1987, 
after  the  S&L  overleverage  crash  of  1990,  and  after  the  Mexi-
can  financial  crisis  of  1994,  the  East  Asian  crisis  of  1997,  the 
Russian state and Long-Term Capital Management hedge-fund 
bankruptcies of 1998, the dot-com crash of 2000, and the 2001 
terrorist attacks.

Surely all this lent confidence that the Federal Reserve could 
handle whatever shocks the finance sector could throw at it. In a 
world that still had a very large gap between average returns on 
safe and risky assets, was it not worthwhile to encourage finan-
cial experimentation, to explore what mechanisms might induce 
more risk-bearing on the part of investors, even if it led to some 
cowboy-finance excesses?5

“It is only when the tide goes out,” long-term investor War-
ren Buffett always likes to say, “that you discover who has been 
swimming  naked.”6  Central  banks’  confidence  that  they  could 
manage whatever problems arose, and center-right governments’ 
enthusiasm  for  financial  nonregulation,  meant  that  a  relatively 
small shock to the global financial system came appallingly close 
to delivering a repeat of the Great Depression in the years after 
2007, and did deliver a lost half-decade as far as global north eco-
nomic progress was concerned.

By 2007, very few of the great and good in the global north 
expected any serious risk of a major financial crisis and threat-
ening depression. The last such in the global north had been in 
the Great Depression itself. Since the 1930s, the memory of the 
financial losses had kept financiers and investors from borrowing 
and leveraging on a scale that would make systems vulnerable to 
a chain of bankruptcies—and thus to a mass panic followed by

a rush to sell at fire-sale prices all the financial assets suddenly 
deemed risky. Not until those who remembered, or whose imme-
diate mentors had remembered, the Great Depression had retired 
would that leash on the financial system be slipped.

As a result, economic crises had in fact been very rare in the 
global north in the years after World War II. Governments that 
prioritized full employment kept recessions modest to stave off 
the losses that might trigger the initial bankruptcies that would 
potentially set off such a downward spiral. One of the two sub-
stantial  postwar  recessions  in  the  global  north,  in  1974–1975, 
was caused by war, a tumultuous Middle East, and disruptions 
in the oil market. The second substantial global-north recession, 
from 1979 to 1982, was deliberately self-inflicted: the price paid 
for Volcker’s Fed breaking the inflationary spiral of prices that 
had arisen in the 1970s.

Yes,  Western  Europe  had  a  stubbornly  high  rate  of  unem-
ployment for decades after 1982, but in the judgment of the neo-
liberal  consensus,  it  was  because  Western  Europe  was  still  too 
social democratic for the market system to work properly.7 And, 
yes,  Japan  fell  into  a  permanent  deflationary  crisis  after  1990, 
but the consensus had long been that Japan was a special case, 
that it was a self-inflicted problem, and that more general lessons 
should not be drawn from it.8 Both within the US government 
and among the public, confidence remained that the neoliberal 
turn had been the right call, that the foundations of prosperity 
were sound, and that risks were low and could be easily managed. 
And as of 2007 there was no inflation, no war in the Middle East 
of large enough scale to trigger any prolonged supply shortage. 
In any event the dominance of Middle Eastern oil in the energy 
sector of the economy had been greatly attenuated.

There were Cassandras. In 2005, at the US Federal Reserve 
system’s annual conference in Wyoming, held in the shadow of 
the Grand Tetons, economist and future Reserve Bank of India 
governor Raghuram Rajan presented a paper warning not so much

of a chain-of-bankruptcies crisis and a potential depression as of 
“uncertainty”  in  the  sense  of  University  of  Chicago  economist 
Frank Knight.9 The financial system had grown so opaque that 
nobody  knew  what  the  systemic  risks  were,  and  nobody  could 
even calculate reasonable probabilities. Everyone commenting on 
Rajan’s paper said they had enjoyed reading it. Almost everyone 
(there was one exception, economist and former Fed vice chair 
Alan Blinder) also subjected Rajan to “unremitting attack.” Ra-
jan, they said, was being Chicken Little. Things were at least as 
robust and as sound as ever before. Not only was there no need to 
worry, Rajan’s worrying was to be lamented.

They were, of course, grotesquely wrong. The emergence and 
rapid  growth  of  financial  derivatives  meant  that  nobody  could 
now tell where any losses that flowed into the financial system 
would ultimately come to rest. That meant that, should a crisis 
come, everyone would have to regard all their counterparties with 
great suspicion, as institutions that might be insolvent and might 
not pay. It was the equivalent of painting the windshield of a car 
black. And so the world economy drove into a wall, with those 
at the wheel only belatedly hoping the air bags would deploy and 
prove adequate.

Axel Weber, who had been at the helm of Germany’s central 
bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, in the mid-2000s, told a rueful 
story in 2013.10 There was a bank, the Deutsche Bank, that had 
for nearly 150 years been one of the world’s largest commercial 
banks, with a wide scope of business interests. Since “Deutsche 
Bundesbank” sounded like “Deutsche Bank,” he wound up by 
accident on a panel alongside a number of CEOs of large com-
mercial banks. At the panel, they talked about what marvelously 
profitable things they were doing with derivatives: buying mort-
gages, bundling them together, chopping up the financial flows 
from them into pieces they judged risky and pieces they judged 
safe, and then selling them off—the risky pieces to those inves-
tors willing to run risks for higher return, the safe pieces to those

willing  to  sacrifice  return  for  safety.  Profit!  They  reassured  the 
audience: yes, this strategy would work only as long as their fi-
nancial modeling was good enough to actually determine which 
tranches of the financial flows were risky and which were safe. 
But the commercial banks’ stockholders should not worry: they 
sold off all of the derivative financial instruments they created.

Then, at the panel, Axel Weber got up and said that as the 
German central bank was one of their regulators, he could see 
that while the twenty largest commercial banks were the largest 
creators and sellers and suppliers of securitization products, they 
were also the largest buyers. He told them: “As a system [you] 
have not diversified.” Each individual bank was not exposed to 
the risk that its own financial models were wrong. It had, after 
all, sold off all of the financial instruments it had created using its 
models. The risk that the models were wrong thus lay on the pur-
chasers. But some of those—many of those—assets were being 
purchased by the other major banks. Each of them gave its own 
models some scrutiny. But each of them did not give the models 
of the banks whose created securities they were buying any scru-
tiny, for the assets they were buying were rated AAA.

They were not set up, bureaucratically, to wonder: Are these 
things  we  are  buying  really  ultra-high-quality  AAA?  We  know 
that when we create derivative securities, we play games in order 
to get them the AAA seal of approval.

The  banking  industry,  Axel  Weber  said,  “was  not  aware  at 
the time that while its treasury department was reporting that it 
bought  all  these  [high-yielding]  products  its  credit  department 
was  reporting  that  it  had  sold  off  all  the  risk.”11  Indeed,  Bob  
Rubin—who took over as head of Citigroup in November 2007, 
just in time to be in charge when all the chickens came home to 
roost—confessed that month that the previous July was the first 
time he had ever heard of a feature of Citigroup-created securi-
ties, called a “liquidity put,” that was going to wind up costing 
Citigroup perhaps $20 billion.12

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

Now comes the rueful part: Axel Weber said he had viewed 
this  as  an  issue  that  was  potentially  important  for  bank  CEOs 
and bank stockholders who did not understand how risky banks’ 
portfolios of assets actually were. He did not view it as any of his 
business as a central banker, however, as a potential source of sys-
temic risk, or as a problem that might give rise to a serious depres-
sion. It was a reasonable calculation. It is reasonable to suppose 
that, had the Great Recession been avoided, the total unexpected 
losses  of  those  holding  mortgage-backed  derivative  securities 
would  have  been  only  $500  billion.  In  a  world  economy  with 
$80 trillion in assets, that should not have been a big deal. The 
dot-com crash of 2000 had carried with it $4 trillion in losses, yet 
had not brought the financial economy near to a serious crisis. 
Plus, Weber had shared the great confidence that central banks 
could handle whatever shocks the financial system might throw 
at it. During US Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan’s tenure, 
from 1987 to 2005, after all, the US financial system had suffered 
and survived the 1987 stock market crash, the 1989 S&L bank-
ruptcies, the 1994 Mexican crisis, the 1997 East Asian crisis, the 
2000 dot-com crash, and the 2001 terrorist attacks. And behind 
it all was the confident neoliberal consensus that markets were 
smarter than governments: that the market had a wisdom and a 
will, and knew what it was doing.

All this was hubris, overweening self-confidence. And it bred 
nemesis, or retributive comeuppance. But because the former is 
heady fun and the latter unpleasant, few have had the patience 
to linger over the better lessons. After 2009, neoliberal techno-
crats  were  unable  to  explain  why  they  had  been  so  sanguine. 
The evidence of an impending crisis had been visible. There had 
been crises in Mexico in 1994–1995, East Asia in 1997–1998, 
Russia in 1998, and then Brazil, Turkey, and Argentina. All of 
them knew that a chain-of-bankruptcies crisis might have a cata-
strophic outcome—that countries hit by financial crisis suffered 
not only a short-run depression, but often a sharp and sometimes

longer-run slowdown in growth as well. Global current account 
imbalances,  unusually  low  interest  rates,  and  bubble-like  asset 
prices—they were there to see.13 And yet in the wake of the neo-
liberal turn, financial markets were more lightly regulated than 
ever. The principal fear was always that an overly intrusive gov-
ernment might hobble the market.

After the crisis, many argued that both the Great Recession 
and the housing bubble of the mid-2000s that preceded it had 
been inevitable—or in some sense necessary. “We should have a 
recession. People who spend their lives pounding nails in Nevada 
need something else to do,” said University of Chicago econo-
mist  John  Cochrane  in  November  2008.14  He  was  but  one  of 
many  trained  professional  economists,  who  really  should  have 
known better, but who adhered to this Hayekian line: there could 
not be a big depression unless the economy somehow needed to 
generate one, and so when they saw a depression coming they 
looked around for the need. The case seemed very plausible, for 
it fell into the template of hubris and nemesis. Housing prices 
had  been  too  high,  housing  construction  had  been  too  rapid, 
and housing stock had grown to excess. Housing construction 
needed to be drastically cut back. Workers in the construction 
sector would be put out of work, but they would then also have 
an incentive to find other jobs in sectors where their work would 
be socially useful.

In point of fact, Cochrane was 100 percent wrong. By Novem-
ber 2008 there was no sense in which construction employment 
“needed” to fall. It had managed to make its adjustment from its 
boom-bubble 2005 high back to normal and even subnormal levels 
in 2006 and 2007, without a recession. By November 2008, em-
ployment in construction nationwide—and in Nevada—was well 
below its normal and average share of the US workforce. Rather 
than having to be pushed into unemployment, adjustment had 
already taken place. It had taken place via workers being pulled 
into export and investment manufacturing—without a recession.

You simply do not need a recession for structural adjustment 
to take place. Indeed, it is hard to see how pushing people out of 
low-productivity  occupations  into  the  zero  productivity  of  un-
employment is a constructive “adjustment” when the alternative 
of having high demand to pull them out of low- and into high- 
productivity occupations is available.

But the attraction of “the market giveth, the market taketh 
away; blessed be the name of the market” is very strong. Econ-
omies  do  need,  sometimes,  structural  adjustment  to  rebalance 
workers to where future demand will be. There are, sometimes, 
big depressions. Therefore, said Hayek and Schumpeter—and a 
host of others as well, from Andrew Mellon and Herbert Hoover 
and John Cochrane and Eugene Fama to even Karl Marx—big 
depressions are this adjustment.

The story was very tempting. And telling the story that way 
pushed blame back from those in charge of the world economy 
from 2005 on to other, earlier policy makers no longer on the 
scene. So they pushed the chain of argument backward: Why was 
the housing stock too high? Because construction had been too 
rapid. Why was construction too rapid? Because housing prices 
were too high. Why were prices too high? Because of too-low in-
terest rates and too-available financing. Why were interest rates so 
low and financing so readily available? That question had several 
different answers.

After the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, investors were left 
with  fewer  productive  places  in  which  to  put  their  savings.  At 
the same time, the industrializing countries of Asia were running 
large trade surpluses with the North Atlantic and accumulating 
large stockpiles of cash, with which they hoped to buy assets (pri-
marily bonds) in North Atlantic economies (primarily the United 
States). For China, especially, this became a development strat-
egy: maintain full employment in Shanghai by (indirectly) lend-
ing America’s consumers the renminbi they need to keep their 
purchases up. The result was what future Federal Reserve chair

Ben Bernanke called a “global savings glut,” or an excess demand 
for savings vehicles worldwide.15

This glut threatened to turn the small global economic down-
turn of 2000–2002 into a big downturn. To fend that off, the 
number of bonds being issued by businesses needed to be ramped 
up to satisfy the worldwide demand for savings vehicles. Glob-
ally, central banks responded to the savings glut by flooding the 
world with liquidity—buying bonds for cash and promising to 
continue such easy money policies in the future. The intent was 
to lower interest rates and therefore the cost of capital to firms, 
thereby motivating firms to scale up their operations and build 
future capacity. To some degree this worked: corporate invest-
ment did rise. But it had unintended and severe consequences: 
lower  interest  rates  generated  a  mortgage  and  a  financial  engi-
neering boom, which generated a housing boom, which returned 
the United States and the other global-north economies to full 
employment.16

Home  prices,  however,  rose  much  more  than  they  should 
have, given how low mortgage rates were. To understand why, 
we  need  to  understand  the  drastic  changes  made  to  mortgage 
financing and financial engineering during the 2000s. By now 
the litany is familiar: the old model of banking, in which banks 
held  on  to  the  loans  they  made,  was  replaced  by  the  practice 
of  originate-and-distribute.  Mortgage  originators—firms  that 
in many cases had no traditional banking business—made loans 
to buy houses, then quickly sold those loans off to other firms. 
These firms then repackaged the loans by pooling them and sell-
ing shares of these pools. Rating agencies were then willing to 
bestow their seal of approval, the AAA rating, on the more senior 
of these securities, those that had first claim on interest and prin-
cipal repayment.

In the United States, housing prices would ultimately shoot 
up by 75 percent between 1997 and 2005, but the bubble wasn’t 
limited to the States. Throughout the North Atlantic region, real

estate  prices  soared,  more  than  doubling  in  Britain  and  nearly 
doubling in Spain. Everyone ignored the risks, and the bubble 
continued  to  inflate.  And  when  the  bust  came,  much  of  that 
claimed-AAA paper turned out to be worth less than twenty-five 
cents on the dollar.

Everyone agreed that there were lessons to be learned in all 
of this, but specifying exactly what those lessons were required 
identifying the correct underlying problems—and there was far 
less agreement about that.

For some, the problem was overregulation: the Federal Re-
serve and other government agencies had been forcing banks to 
lend  to  financially  unsound  and  unworthy—read,  minority—
buyers because of things like the Community Reinvestment Act. 
It was impious interference with the market, the last ebbing rem-
nants of social democracy in government interfering to give lazy 
and unproductive minorities good things they did not deserve, that 
had broken the system and caused the catastrophe. Except there 
was never a shred of evidence supporting this argument. But that 
did not matter for its advocates: they had faith that the market 
could not fail unless it was perverted by social democracy, and 
faith is assurance and certainty about things that we do not see.

Others,  along  similar  but  less  racist  lines,  felt  the  problem 
was that the US government simply had no business subsidizing 
housing lending in the first place. For this there was a convinc-
ing rationale, but the overall assessment was still faulty. Programs 
that provided subsidies to mortgage lenders and borrowers, such 
as  the  Federal  National  Mortgage  Administration  (FNMA,  or 
“Fannie Mae”), did drive up prices. But during the 2000s, Fannie 
Mae played no role in the additional jump in prices, for its price 
pressure was there at the start and did not grow during the hous-
ing boom. The lending that allowed buyers to purchase houses at 
higher and higher prices was primarily made by private specialized 
mortgage lenders such as the infamously bankrupt Countrywide, 
not Fannie Mae or any other government-sponsored enterprise.

Great Recession and Anemic Recovery 

Another theory was that the problem was the Federal Reserve’s 
insistence on keeping interest rates so low. The Federal Reserve 
did reduce the overnight rate on loans between banks, from 6.5 
percent per year in 2000 to 1 percent per year in 2003. But the 
European Central Bank (ECB) reduced interest rates by only half 
as much as the Federal Reserve did, so, according to this theory, 
we would expect Europe to have experienced a smaller bubble. 
Europe’s housing bubbles, however, were, if anything, larger than 
those in the United States. Overlooking this inconvenient fact, 
many argued that the Federal Reserve should have started raising 
interest rates in the spring of 2002, a year before the unemploy-
ment rate peak of the early 2000s, rather than waiting until the 
year after. But keeping interest rates 2.5 percentage points below 
the optimal path for two years only pushed up warranted hous-
ing values by 5 percent—much too little to drive any significant 
amount  of  overbuilding  or  any  significant  part  of  the  spike  in 
housing prices.

A  final  explanation  of  what  drove  the  housing  bubble  was 
that  it  was  not  too  much  regulation,  but  too  little.  Down- 
payment requirements and the standards by which creditworthy 
home buyers were matched to homes they could afford were ren-
dered a joke. This was a fair assessment, but requires a caveat: 
it doesn’t explain the jump-the-rail moment in 2008. By 2005, 
establishment concern about financial stability had shifted from 
America’s enormous trade deficit with Asia to its surging prop-
erty markets, which had unmistakably become a bubble. Could 
an obviously overheating market be cooled without sending the 
United States, and its main trading partners around the world, 
into an economic tailspin?

The answer was that it could be and it was.
Mark  this,  for  it  is  important:  the  whole  premise  that  the 
Great Recession was in some way a necessary adjustment after the 
housing boom is wrong. Housing prices had begun to fall early 
in 2005. By the end of 2007, the massive migration of workers

into the housing sector had been reversed, and housing construc-
tion fell back below its average share of total economic activity. 
Had Cochrane said there were too many people pounding nails 
in Nevada in late 2005, he would have been correct—although 
the  claim  that  a  recession  was  “needed”  would  still  have  been 
false. But by 2008, the claim that there were too many people 
pounding nails in Nevada was simply and completely false—and 
obviously  so  to  anyone  who  even  glanced  at  Bureau  of  Labor 
Statistics  counts  of  workers  employed  in  construction.  For  by 
early 2008 the US economy had already found other things to 
occupy all the extra construction workers, and a recession wasn’t 
necessary to accomplish this. In a properly dynamic economy, 
the  reallocation  of  workers  from  shrinking  to  growing  sectors 
takes place because of incentives, and need not involve unem-
ployment benefits: workers are happy to leave their current jobs 
and move into growing sectors if those industries can offer them 
higher wages.

The idea that the Great Recession was inevitable, or in some 
sense necessary, or even wise, given the housing boom, fits our 
narrative expectations of transgression and retribution, of hubris 
and nemesis. And there was hubris. And there was nemesis. There 
is something exculpatory to faith in a market that gives, takes, 
and is blessed either way. What is given and what taken is never 
the acolytes’ fault. And it was for those with the purest faith in 
a Hayekian market that the Great Recession was declared inev-
itable, or in some sense necessary, or even wise. For them, the 
housing boom fit a narrative expectation of transgression and ret-
ribution, of hubris and nemesis.
But it did not take that form.
Understanding the form that nemesis took in the global north 
after 2007 requires patience. The simple, short path of blameless 
faith in a wiser-than-thou market is insufficient. Understanding 
requires  a  reminder  of  the  root  causes  of  high-unemployment 
recessions  and  depressions.  It  is  then  possible  to  see  why  the

particular chain-of-bankruptcies type of downturn that was the 
Great Recession of 2007–2009 came as such a surprise.

Recall what was cutting-edge macroeconomic theory back in 
1829, when John Stuart Mill pointed out that a “general glut”—
an excess supply of produced commodities and workers, not in 
one sector but pretty much everywhere in the economy—emerged 
whenever there was an excess demand for whatever served that 
economy as cash. That is to say, assets that everyone was confi-
dent would hold their value and that were “liquid,” in the sense 
that people would be eager to accept them in payment for com-
modities or to discharge debts.17

Cash in an economy is very special because it serves as a means 
of payment. If you have a demand for anything else, you satisfy 
that demand by going out and buying more of it. But if you have 
a demand for cash, you can either sell stuff (for cash, naturally), 
or you can stop buying stuff. Keep your cash income the same 
and reduce your cash outflow, and your normal cash inflows will 
pile up. Your demand for cash will be satisfied. Simple.18

This principle is at the root of high-unemployment recessions 
and depressions. This way of satisfying your demand for cash by 
buying less works for individuals, but it cannot work for the entire 
economy. One person’s cash inflows are another’s cash outflows, 
after all. When everyone tries to push their cash outflow below 
their cash inflow, each individual’s cash inflow drops along with 
their outflow. The excess demand for cash remains unsatisfied. 
All that happens is that the total sum of incomes in the economy 
amounts to less, and so people buy less stuff and fewer people are 
employed.

Such an excess demand for cash can happen in three different 

ways:

The first I call a monetarist depression. A good example is the 
United States during 1982. Paul Volcker’s Federal Reserve had 
sought to reduce inflation by reducing the total flow of spending 
in the economy. It did so by selling bonds to banks and investors,

requiring  as  payment  that  banks  reduce  their  balances  in  their 
Federal Reserve accounts. This left the banks with less cash than 
they would have preferred to have in their reserve account bal-
ances.  In  order  to  build  those  balances  back  up,  they  reduced 
their spending, which meant giving out fewer loans to businesses. 
Because of this, fewer businesses opened or expanded—and ulti-
mately, unemployment kissed 11 percent by the time I graduated 
from college in the summer of 1982.

You can tell when the economy is in a monetarist depression 
because  the  interest  rates  that  bonds  pay  are  high.  Here’s  how 
that happens. When many players in the economy are trying to 
build up their liquid cash balances by selling bonds, bond prices 
go down. To induce purchases, the interest rates that bonds pay 
are high. Consider that from the summer of 1979 to the fall of 
1981 the interest rate on the US government’s ten-year Treasury 
bond  rose  from  8.8  percent  per  year  to  15.8  percent  per  year. 
That was the Federal Reserve setting the Volcker disinflation, and 
its associated monetarist depression, in motion.

The cure for a monetarist depression is straightforward: have 
the  central  bank  increase  the  economy’s  money  stock.  When 
Volcker’s  Federal  Reserve  decided  that  spending  had  fallen 
enough to bring inflation under control, it bought back bonds for 
cash. Voilà. The excess demand for cash in the economy evapo-
rated almost overnight, and over 1983–1985 the economy roared 
back with very rapid growth in production and employment.

A second scenario that triggers excess demand for cash is what 
I call a Keynesian depression. People in general divide their cash 
outflows  into  three  streams:  cash  spent  on  goods  and  services, 
cash  for  paying  taxes,  and  cash  for  buying  investments.  One 
way that people can invest their cash is in business-issued stocks, 
which raise the money a business uses to fund growth. But sup-
pose businesses get fearful, are depressed, and decide not to issue 
stock in order to expand their operations. Then the price of the 
other financial investment vehicles the economy is creating will

go up, and the rate of profit offered on them will go down—they 
will become very much like cash, save that they will also be risky 
should the company that backs them dry up and blow away.

In  such  circumstances,  people  will  decide  that  they  would 
rather hold extra cash instead of expensive and dubious invest-
ment vehicles. These decisions, in turn, will lead to an economy- 
wide excess demand for cash. With it comes the “general glut” 
of  commodities,  idle  factories,  and  the  high  unemployment  of 
a depression. The depressed state of the world economy during 
the  2020–2022  coronavirus  pandemic—not  the  initial  panic 
shutdown, but later—was such a Keynesian depression. People 
were willing to pay for financial investment vehicles, and so bond 
and stock prices were high and bond yields and stock earnings 
yields were low. But businesses were waiting for the pandemic 
to pass before they would begin to expand again. And so people 
demanded excess cash to hold as a substitute for normal financial 
investment vehicles.

The central bank cannot cure a Keynesian depression by in-
creasing  the  money  stock.  The  way  central  banks  increase  the 
money stock is by buying bonds for cash. But in so doing, it gives 
firms cash to hold while taking other financial investment vehicles 
off of the private sector’s balance sheet. The one neutralizes the 
other: the shortage of total financial investment vehicles—cash 
held plus others—remains. The cure for a Keynesian depression 
is for the government to either incentivize businesses to expand, 
and in so doing create the financial investment vehicles the econ-
omy lacks, or sell its own bonds and then return the cash to the 
private sector by spending it, to satisfy the demand for financial 
investment vehicles. The latter translates into a larger-than-usual 
deficit, for the government then needs to spend the cash it has 
earned in order to keep it circulating in the economy.

But what happened over 2007–2009 was neither a monetarist 
depression nor a Keynesian depression. It was, rather, what I call a 
Minskyite depression, after St. Louis economist Hyman Minsky.19

In this type of downturn, what there is a shortage of—what 
there is an excess demand for—is safe stores of value: assets that 
are either cash or can be quickly turned into cash at little or no 
discount to their face value. Safe is the operative word.20 Over 
2007–2009, the world was not short of means-of-payment cash 
or  financial  investment  vehicles.  You  could  buy  risky  savings 
vehicles—private  debt  that  was  not  AAA  rated,  and  the  stocks 
of companies that faced some market and growth risk—for an 
absolute song. And central banks, in their attempts to stem the 
onrushing downturn, worked hard to make the world absolutely 
awash in cash. But over 2007–2009 a great many “safe” assets 
that had been issued by investment banks as AAA rated turned 
out not to be so safe. And people scrambled to sell them and shift 
their portfolios into cash instead.

Where did this safe-asset shortage come from? It emerged in 
the second half of 2007. Too many financiers had bet too heav-
ily on a continued boom in housing prices, leveraging themselves 
precariously. Thus the real estate bust created a crisis of confidence 
in much of the world’s financial system, and eventually paralyzed 
crucial parts of it. Signs of strain had already begun appearing in 
the late summer of 2007. The Federal Reserve reacted by standing 
ready to provide liquidity at normal market rates to institutions 
that found themselves momentarily embarrassed. But it showed 
little  willingness  to  take  broader  action—to  substantially  ease 
monetary conditions, or begin acting as a lender of last resort. It 
feared encouraging more imprudent lending in the future.

At the end of 2007, Federal Reserve vice chair Donald Kohn 
was nervous. “We should not hold the economy hostage to teach 
a small segment of the population a lesson,” he warned.21 But his 
view was a minority one back then, and so it remained until it was 
too late. And that is why the Great Recession of 2007–2009 came 
as such a surprise.

In March 2008 I myself had reasoned that the problem was 
manageable.22  Perhaps  5  million  houses  had  been  built  in  the 

502

desert between Los Angeles and Albuquerque that should never 
have been built. On average, each carried $100,000 in mortgage 
debt that would never be paid and that somebody would have 
to eat. So, I figured, there was a $500 billion financial loss from 
the housing crash that holders of financial securities would have 
to bear, one way or another. But, the dot-com crash involved an 
even greater financial loss—and the dot-com crash only pushed 
unemployment  up  by  about  1.5  percent.  The  housing  crisis,  I 
concluded, was unlikely to have large effects on the economy. But 
the market reasoned differently.

As  a  large  swath  of  those  with  money  who  move  financial 
markets  saw  things,  there  were  $500  billion  in  known  losses 
somewhere. But maybe that was just the tip of an iceberg. Maybe 
the trained professionals who had told us that owning tranches 
of millions of houses between Los Angeles and Albuquerque was 
safe had lied, or were profoundly misinformed. The desire on the 
part  of  investors  to  dump  risky  assets—at  any  price—and  buy 
safer ones—at any price—became an imperative.

The desire on the part of the Fed and the Treasury to prevent 
Wall Street from profiting from the crisis drove their decisions 
in September 2008. Previously, equity shareholders had been se-
verely punished when their firms were judged too big to fail—the 
shareholders of Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac 
essentially had all their wealth confiscated. But this was not true 
of bondholders and counterparties, who were paid in full.

The  Fed  and  Treasury  feared  that  a  bad  lesson  was  being 
taught. To unteach that lesson required, at some point, allowing 
a bank to fail. Hubris, after all, needed its comeuppance. And so 
they decided to let the Lehman Brothers investment bank collapse 
in an uncontrolled bankruptcy without oversight, supervision, or 
guarantees. In retrospect, this was the major mistake.

All hell broke loose. Investors dumped assets they had thought 
were safe only to discover an extremely limited supply of truly safe 
assets.  Panic  selling  set  in  as  investors  urgently  sought  to  avoid 

503

being the ones left holding on to unsellable risky assets. The result 
was that financial losses were magnified by a factor of forty: what 
would have been a $500 billion destruction of wealth became the 
destruction of somewhere between $60 trillion and $80 trillion. 
During the winter of 2008–2009, borrowing costs for almost ev-
eryone except governments soared, and the world economy looked 
dangerously close to a complete meltdown.

How do you cure such a safe-asset shortage?
What will not work is the central bank expanding the money 
supply via its so-called open-market operations—in other words, 
buying bonds for cash. Yes, this provides cash, a safe asset, but 
only by taking another safe asset, short-term government bonds, 
off  the  table.  The  result  is  a  continued  shortage  of  safe  assets. 
What will also not work is incentivizing businesses to expand by 
issuing stock. There is no shortage of risky assets to hold, just a 
shortage of safe assets. Stocks don’t meet the need.

There are, however, a number of things that can be done. In 
fact, a standard playbook has been in existence ever since the Brit-
ish journalist Walter Bagehot, the editor of The Economist, wrote 
his book about financial crises, Lombard Street, in the 1870s. Call 
it  the  Bagehot-Minsky  playbook.23  In  a  Minskyite  depression, 
such as the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, 
a government’s best bet is to immediately combat the shortage 
of safe assets by lending freely on collateral that is good in normal 
times,  but  to  do  so  at  a  penalty  rate.  The  “lending  freely”  part 
means to create enough safe assets that they are no longer in short 
supply. The “good in normal times” part means to try to distin-
guish institutions that are in trouble and face bankruptcy only be-
cause of the financial crisis from institutions that are permanently 
insolvent and need to be put into receivership. The “penalty rate” 
part means to discourage opportunistic financiers from exploiting 
the situation.

A number of the things that could be done were tried over 
2007–2009.  Central  banks  took  risk  off  of  the  private  sector’s 

504

balance sheet and put it onto their own by buying up long-term 
risky assets for cash, and so increasing the supply of safe assets. 
This quantitative easing was a good idea, but central banks suf-
fered  from  sticker  shock.  They  balked  at  spending  what  was 
needed, and so this effort was only marginally effective. Govern-
ments also increased the supply of safe assets by running bigger 
deficits, issuing bonds, and using the resulting purchasing power 
to put people to work directly. This strategy was generally effec-
tive, but worked only in cases where the government’s debts were 
perceived as safe assets.

Governments  also  offered  loan  guarantees  and  asset  swaps, 
transforming unsafe savings vehicles into safe ones—by far the 
cheapest and most effective method of combatting a Minskyite 
depression. However, to do this effectively, governments needed 
expertise in pricing these guarantees and swaps. Too high, and 
no one would buy them and the economy would crash. Too low, 
and financiers would take the government—and the public—to 
the cleaners. Moreover, such loan guarantees and asset swaps treat 
unequals equally: those who have been financially imprudent and 
bear some responsibility for the crisis get bailed out, along with 
those whose only fault was getting caught in the unexpected fi-
nancial whirlwind.

The  safest  play  for  governments  would  have  been  to  boost 
purchases and let the short-run deficit go where it needed to go 
to preserve full employment. That’s what China did, starting its 
massive fiscal-stimulus and job-creation policies in the middle of 
2008. Only China’s government grasped that the key task was 
to do whatever it took to keep the flow of spending through the 
economy high enough to avoid mass unemployment. And only 
China avoided the Great Recession. The proof? China continued 
to grow. The United States and Europe did not.

The most imprudent play was to assume that things would not 
get worse. Yet that is what the governments of the global north 
and their central banks did. Spending and employment collapsed.

The US unemployment rate would ultimately rise to a peak of 10 
percent in late 2009, and would not even begin to recover until 
2012. In fact, US unemployment could have risen much higher. 
According to the economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, if the 
government had followed the cold-turkey policies advocated by 
Republicans during the early years of the Obama administration, 
unemployment  would  have  been  driven  to  16  percent,  about 
halfway  between  the  actual  peak  and  the  peak  unemployment 
rate of the Great Depression.24

In  September  2008,  I  had  been  confident  that  the  world’s 
governments were capable of keeping the world economy out of 
a deep and long depression. By March 2009 it was clear that I had 
been wrong and that they had failed. The problem was not that 
economists who were reality based were unsure about what to do 
and how to apply the Bagehot-Minsky playbook—the problem 
was  that  assembling  the  political  coalition  to  do  it  was  judged 
impossible.  Put  differently,  governments  and  politicians  found 
there was no political will to dole out nemesis in useful measure 
to hubris in ways that would provide a net benefit to the recover-
ing economy. And so many governments, instead of taking dras-
tic and immediate action, decided simply to wait and see what 
would happen.

In Blinder’s and Zandi’s judgment—and mine—the alphabet 
soup of interventions by the Federal Reserve to guarantee loans, 
expand the money supply, and take risk off of the private sector’s 
balance sheet was quite effective. The TARP and the TALF and 
the HAMP and the Federal Reserve’s quantitative-easing poli-
cies and extra deficit spending via the ARRA—and all the other 
government interventions—together accomplished 6 percent of 
the  10  percent  reduction-in-unemployment-relative-to-where-
it-would-otherwise-have-been  job  that  the  government  should 
have carried out when the crisis hit.25 That is three-fifths of the 
job—and  a  glass  three-fifths  full  is  not  empty.  On  the  other 
hand, the glass remained two-fifths empty. And forecasts in 2011

that the restoration of full employment would take a long time 
turned out to be accurate. There was no “bounce back” rapid 
recovery. Indeed, for the first four years of the recovery, workers’ 
ability to find jobs barely improved.

Recall  the  Bagehot-Minsky  playbook:  lend  freely  at  a  pen-
alty rate on collateral that is good in normal times. Policy makers 
did  rush  in.  Financial  institutions  were  bailed  out  at  taxpayer 
expense.  Guarantees  were  extended  to  restore  confidence— 
Ireland, for example, took the extraordinary step of guarantee-
ing  all  Irish  bank  debt.  Central  banks  and  government  agen-
cies stepped in as “lenders of last resort,” providing credit where 
banks  could  or  would  not.  These  measures  were  successful  in 
stemming the panic—by the early summer of 2009, most mea-
sures  of  financial  stress  had  subsided  to  more  or  less  normal 
levels, and the world economy ended its headlong plunge. But 
that was just the “lend freely” part. Governments neglected to 
implement  the  “good  in  normal  times”  part  of  the  Bagehot- 
Minsky  playbook.  Not  even  too-big-to-fail  Citigroup  was  put 
into receivership. Worse still, governments completely ignored 
the “penalty rate” part: bankers and investors, even or perhaps 
especially those whose actions had created the systemic risks that 
caused the crisis, profited handsomely.

Financial bailouts are always unfair because they reward those 
who made bad bets on risky assets. But the alternative would be 
a policy that destroys the web of finance—and thus a policy that 
shuts down dynamism in the real economy. A crash in prices of 
risky financial assets sends a message: shut down risky production 
activities and don’t undertake any new activities that might be 
risky. That is a recipe for a deep, prolonged depression. The polit-
ical problems that spring from financial bailouts can be finessed. 
The fallout from a major depression cannot. Thus, financial res-
cue operations that benefit even the unworthy can be accepted if 
they are seen as benefiting all. In 2007–2009, for instance, teach-
ing a few thousand feckless financiers not to overspeculate was

ultimately far less important than securing the jobs of millions of 
Americans and tens of millions around the globe.

When vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp attacked Vice 
President Al Gore in 1996 for the Clinton administration’s deci-
sion to bail out Mexico’s feckless government during the 1994–
1995  financial  crisis,  Gore  responded  that  they  had  charged 
Mexico a penalty rate and so the United States had made $1.5 
billion on the deal.26 In 1997–1998, Clinton’s treasury secretary, 
Robert Rubin, and IMF managing director Michel Camdessus 
were attacked for committing public money to bail out New York 
banks that had loaned to feckless East Asian countries. They re-
sponded that they had “bailed in” the banks, rather than bailing 
them out, by requiring them to cough up additional money to 
support South Korea’s economy; and that everyone had benefited 
massively, because a global recession was avoided. In 2009, how-
ever, the US government could say none of these things. What 
was readily apparent, however, was that bankers continued to re-
ceive bonuses even as the real economy continued to shed jobs.

Perhaps there was a rationale. Perhaps policy makers recog-
nized that assembling a political coalition in the United States 
or in Western Europe to do what China was doing—have the 
government borrow and spend on the scale needed to preserve 
or promote a rapid return to full employment—was not going 
to happen. Given that reality, policy makers would have realized 
that the only way to generate enough spending and investing to 
drive a rapid recovery was to restore the confidence of businesses 
and investors. And decapitating banks and deposing bank exec-
utives, placing banks into receivership, and confiscating bonuses 
would do the opposite.

But I think the most likely explanation is that policy makers 
simply  did  not  understand  the  situation—nor  did  they  under-
stand the Bagehot-Minsky playbook.

In any event, the situation was on its face outrageous: bankers 
were getting bailed out while unemployment hit 10 percent and

huge numbers of people faced foreclosure. If policy makers had 
focused more on the “penalty rate” part of the Bagehot-Minsky 
playbook, they might at least have moderated that perception of 
unfairness—and potentially built more of a political base for fur-
ther action. But they did not, and so there was very little public 
trust in governments to take the steps necessary to spur recovery.
But this is not the only reason the much-touted effort to re-
store the “confidence” of financiers and investors failed to pro-
duce much of a recovery after 2009. The global north’s economy 
was still hamstrung with too much risky debt.

At the macro level, the story of the post-2008 decade is almost 
always understood as a failure of economic analysis and commu-
nication. We economists supposedly failed to convey to politi-
cians and bureaucrats what needed to be done, because we hadn’t 
analyzed the situation fully and properly in real time. But many 
of us did understand.

For example, consider Greece: When the Greek debt crisis 
erupted  in  2010,  it  seemed  to  me  that  the  lessons  of  history 
were so obvious that the path to a resolution would be straight-
forward. The logic was clear. Had Greece not been a member 
of  the  euro  zone,  its  best  option  would  have  been  to  default, 
restructure  its  debt,  and  depreciate  its  currency.  But  because 
the European Union did not want Greece to exit the euro zone 
(which would have been a major setback for Europe as a polit-
ical project), it made sense that it would offer Greece enough 
aid, debt forgiveness, and assistance with payments to offset any 
advantages  it  might  gain  by  exiting  the  monetary  union.  But 
this did not come to pass. Instead, Greece’s creditors unexpect-
edly  chose  to  tighten  the  screws.  As  a  result,  Greece  is  likely 
much worse off today than it would have been had it abandoned 
the euro in 2010. Iceland, which was hit by a financial crisis in 
2008,  provides  the  counterfactual.  Whereas  Greece  remained 
mired in depression, Iceland—not in the euro zone—recovered, 
and recovered quickly.

In the United States, as well, policy makers lifted their foot 
off the gas pedal in the early 2010s. Future historians will find 
least  comprehensible  the  unwillingness  of  governments  at  that 
moment to borrow and spend. Starting in the mid-2000s, there 
came an era of what the economist Larry Summers has named 
“secular  stagnation”:  a  time  of  very  low  interest  rates  on  safe 
bonds, driven by a shortage of risk-bearing capacity and a hunger 
for safe assets on the part of insecure private investors.27 As long 
as these circumstances held, governments could truly borrow for 
free. By now most economists agree that in such situations, gov-
ernments should take advantage and borrow. I always found it 
hard to believe—and still do—that anybody could or can take 
exception to this.28

And yet, at the start of 2010, in his State of the Union Ad-
dress,  President  Barack  Obama  said  that  “just  as  families  and 
companies have had to be cautious about spending, government 
must tighten its belt as well.” And he called for a federal spending 
freeze, making clear that he would pursue it at all costs, saying, “If 
I have to enforce this freeze by veto, I will.” Watching, my first 
reaction was that issuing a veto threat against his two chief lieu-
tenants, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader 
Harry Reid, was a unique way of building intraparty comity.29 It 
was  a  previously  unheard-of  way  of  maintaining  a  functioning 
governing  coalition.  In  the  space  of  a  moment,  it  changed  the 
policy discussion from “What should we do?” to “I am the boss!” 
Here we reached the limits of my mental horizons as a neoliberal, 
as a technocrat, and as a mainstream neoclassical economist. The 
global economy was suffering from a grand mal seizure of slack 
demand and high unemployment. We knew the cures. Yet we 
seemed determined to inflict further suffering on the patient.

Obama’s former economic policy staffers say that he was the 
global  north’s  most  rational  and  best-behaved  ruling  politician 
in the first half of the 2010s. And they are right. But it is nev-
ertheless disturbing that Obama’s address—delivered when the

US unemployment rate was still 9.7 percent—went so strongly 
against John Maynard Keynes’s 1937 observation that “the boom, 
not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury.”30 
The arithmetic always seemed clear to me. Starting in 2009, the 
US government could borrow for thirty years at a real interest 
rate of 1 percent per year—or less. Given this, an additional $500 
billion in infrastructure spending would yield enormous benefits 
to the government and the country—at no cost. Investors would 
have effectively been willing to pay the United States to be the 
custodian of their wealth because they were so desperate to hold 
safe assets. Yet Obama seemed completely uninterested.

He was not alone. In the summer of 2011, Federal Reserve 
chair Ben Bernanke offered a rosy assessment: “We expect a mod-
erate  recovery  to  continue  and  indeed  to  strengthen,”  he  pro-
claimed, because “households also have made some progress in 
repairing their balance sheets—saving more, borrowing less, and 
reducing  their  burdens  of  interest  payments  and  debt.”  More-
over, deflation in commodity prices would “help increase house-
hold purchasing power.” And perhaps most promising of all, he 
continued, “the growth fundamentals of the United States do not 
appear  to  have  been  permanently  altered  by  the  shocks  of  the 
past four years.”31 But at that very moment state and local budget 
cutting had slowed America’s pace of investment in human cap-
ital and infrastructure, bringing the country’s long-term growth 
trajectory down by a third percentage point on top of the two it 
had already suffered.

After  the  Great  Depression  of  the  1930s,  the  vast  wave  of 
investment in industrial capacity during World War II made up 
the shortfall of the lost decade. As a result, the Depression did 
not  cast  a  shadow  on  future  growth.  There  was  no  analogous 
set of floodlights deployed to erase the shadow that was cast by 
2008–2010. On the contrary, the shadow lengthened with each 
passing day of stalled recovery. And whereas Franklin Roosevelt 
had inspired confidence that full employment would be rapidly

reattained, because reattaining it was the government’s highest 
priority,  in  the  early  2010s  the  public  was  rightfully  skeptical 
of  the  government’s  commitment  to  reattaining  full  employ-
ment. The result was a half-lost decade of economic growth in 
the United States, when the magnitude of the downturn and the 
sluggishness of the recovery are both taken into account, and in 
much of Western Europe, a full lost decade.

Contrast this with China, where it was certainly not the case 
that blessed be the market whatever it happened to do. China in 
2007 and after knew not so much that the market was made for 
man, but that the market was made for the purpose of serving 
the goals of the Chinese Communist Party. One of those goals 
was maintaining full employment. And so full employment was 
maintained. Were “ghost cities” built and lots of people put to 
work building infrastructure that would decay and degrade be-
fore anybody could use it? Yes. Were unstable financial structures 
constructed that would not be fully accepted by banks without 
government arm-twisting? Yes. But those costs were trivial rel-
ative  to  the  damage  avoided  by  maintaining  full  employment 
and growth through what was, elsewhere, the Great Recession. 
During the Great Recession, China gained from five to ten extra 
years in its race to catch up to the global north.

We can begin to theorize explanations for such irrationality. 
Some highly capable and competent economists, such as Carmen 
M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, saw the dangers of the finan-
cial  crisis,  but  greatly  exaggerated  the  risks  of  public  spending 
to  boost  employment  in  its  aftermath.32  Other  highly  capable 
and competent economists, including Federal Reserve chair Ber-
nanke, understood the importance of keeping interest rates low, 
but overestimated the effectiveness of additional monetary-policy 
tools such as quantitative easing.33 Still others, perhaps less capa-
ble and competent, like me, understood that expansionary mon-
etary policies would not be enough, but, because we had looked 
at global imbalances the wrong way, missed the principal source

of  risk—US  financial  misregulation—and  found  ourselves  still 
trying to catch up to the situation in order to give accurate policy 
advice in real time.34

In hindsight, technocrats’ errors of judgment and failures of 
communication seem to me a large part of how events unfolded 
so disastrously—if we economists had spoken up sooner about 
what we knew about depressions and their cure, had been more 
convincing on the issues where we were right, and had been better 
at recognizing where we were wrong, the situation today might be 
considerably better. Columbia University historian Adam Tooze 
has little use for such a group-action contingency narrative; for 
him, the calamity of the post-2008 decade was a result of deep 
historical  currents.  Financial  deregulation  and  tax  cuts  for  the 
rich became idols for the right—to a greater extent even than they 
already were.35 The fallout from the George W. Bush administra-
tion’s ill-advised war against Iraq effectively squandered Ameri-
ca’s credibility to lead the North Atlantic through the crisis years. 
And the Republican Party began to suffer its nervous breakdown, 
eventually embracing a brutish, race-baiting reality-TV star.

Yet where Tooze sees tides and structures, I see contingency 
and bad luck. I think back to the Great Depression: to, in Japan, 
Takahashi Korekiyo’s rapid devaluation and reflation; to, in Ger-
many,  the  economic  success  of  reflation  (which  was  ultimately 
absolutely  catastrophic  because  it  cemented  the  hold  of  Adolf 
Hitler’s Nazi regime); and to, in the United States, FDR’s New 
Deal. All had much weaker hands to play than Barack Obama 
and his administration in the United States and their counter-
parts in Europe had in 2009. All had much better excuses for not 
grokking the essentials of the situation. All reacted better.

There is a striking contrast between the two US presidents 
Roosevelt and Obama that reinforces my confidence in the view 
that it was contingent luck and choice rather than structural ne-
cessity. Obama could see what was coming. Indeed, he warned 
against  it.  Back  in  2004,  when  he  was  still  a  rising  star  in  the

Democratic  Party,  Obama  had  warned  that  failing  to  build  a 
“purple America” that supported the working and middle classes 
would lead to nativism and political breakdown. In the Great De-
pression, Roosevelt knew what to do to address problems of such 
magnitude.  “The  country  needs . . . bold  persistent  experimen-
tation,” he said in 1932, at the height of the Great Depression. 
“It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit  
it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.”36 Obama 
was unwilling to follow in Roosevelt’s footsteps.

Had the Obama administration been more aggressive, would 
things have been very different? Professional economists could not 
convince those in power of what needed to be done, because those 
in power were operating in a context of political breakdown and 
lost American credibility. With policy-making having been sub-
jected to the malign influence of a rising plutocracy, economists 
calling  for  “bold  persistent  experimentation”  were  swimming 
against  the  tide—even  though  well-founded  economic  theories 
justified precisely that course of action.

But then, nobody expected very much from Roosevelt, who 
in  the  1920s  was  considered  a  second-class  intellect  who  had 
jumped up beyond his station because of his family’s wealth and 
his uncle Teddy’s reputation.37

Fed policy makers still insist that they did the best they could, 
considering the fiscal headwinds at the time. Obama administra-
tion policy makers pat themselves on the back for preventing a 
second Great Depression, and say they did the best they could, 
given the recalcitrant Republican majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives  that  came  to  power  after  the  2010  midterms  and 
promptly turned off the spigot of fiscal stimulus. And somehow, 
these Obama officials fail to mention that their boss had already 
turned it off with his talk of how “the government must tighten 
its belt as well.”38

Right-leaning economists, for their part, still busy themselves 
arguing that the Obama administration’s fiscal policies and Fed

chair  Bernanke’s  monetary  policies  were  dangerously  inflation-
ary. If we are to believe them, we should consider ourselves lucky 
to have escaped an economically disastrous fate like Zimbabwe’s 
hyperinflation.39

In the 2050s, when economic historians compare the “Great 
Recession” that started in 2007 with the Great Depression that 
started in 1929, they will surely praise early twenty-first-century 
policy makers for keeping the later one from becoming a repeat 
of  the  earlier  one.  On  the  other  hand,  these  future  historians 
will be left profoundly puzzled by our failure to remember the 
lessons of 1933. The forceful policies of the New Deal era laid 
the foundations for the rapid and equitable growth of the long 
postwar boom. In the face of such a precedent, how could we 
have failed to see the benefits of a more aggressive stance?

From 1980 on, left-neoliberals had, when they were at the 
wheel, made the neoliberal turn, believing that market incentive- 
utilizing policies were often a much better road to social dem-
ocratic ends than directives and commands and controls from 
on  high  were.  Markets,  after  all—when  properly  managed  to 
preserve competition and correct for Pigouvian externalities—
were  extraordinarily  effective  at  crowdsourcing  solutions,  and 
so using the brainpower of all humanity as an anthology intelli-
gence. And excessive reliance on command-and-control would 
be highly inefficient, and you could not ask voters to be gener-
ous to those whom the market economy did not give opportu-
nity unless growth was rapid. From 1980 on, right-neoliberals 
had, when they were at the wheel, made the neoliberal turn as 
well, believing that the apparent success of social democracy in 
rapid  growth  from  1945–1973  had  been  borrowed  from  the 
past and from the future, and that only renewed submission to 
the logic of the market could produce fast growth again. And 
if that free-market growth produced a greatly unequal income 
and wealth distribution? Then that was good, because that was 
what was deserved.

SLOUCHING TOWARDS UTOPIA

As of 2007, dogmatic neoliberals could still explain the situa-
tion away. Hyperglobalization and neoliberalism looked to have 
been superior to the previous era of too much state-led develop-
ment led by anti-developmental states in the global south. The 
high  income  and  wealth  inequality  of  the  Second  Gilded  Age 
could be sold as a feature rather than a bug for those who wished 
to buy it. The information-technology revolution—and a visible 
future biotechnology revolution—could be sold as a permanent 
return to the golden-age growth pace. The Great Moderation of 
the business cycle—low inflation without periodic shocks of high 
unemployment—looked to prove the excellence and competence 
of neoliberal technocrats. And voters were, if not happy, unwill-
ing to provide majorities for politicians with positions far to the 
left or far to the right of the neoliberal center.

By 2016 it was clear that 2007–2010 had not been a simple 
backfire, after which forward motion resumed as normal. It was 
even clear that things had fallen apart even before 2007: it was 
simply that people had not noticed. The analogy that comes to 
mind is of the old Warner Bros. “Roadrunner” cartoons, in which 
the Roadrunner’s hapless and helpless nemesis Wile E. Coyote 
often  runs  off  of  cliffs,  but  remains  suspended  in  midair  until  
he looks down and recognizes his predicament—only then does 
he plummet into the canyon.

Back at the end of Chapter 2 I noted that US income per 
capita  growth  was  only  0.6  percent  per  year  over  the  decade 
from 2006 to 2016, contrasted with 2.1 percent per year (driven 
by  information  technology,  albeit  unequally  distributed)  over 
1976–2006 and 3.4 percent per year over 1946–1976. In West-
ern  Europe  the  2006–2016  falloff  was  worse:  0.6  percent  per 
year  in  Britain,  0.3  percent  per  year  in  France,—0.9  percent  
per year in Italy, and 1.1 percent per year in Germany.

Whatever  you  had  thought  of  “neoliberalism”  in  2007,  its 
creation of an intellectual and policy-making climate that pro-
duced this massively subpar response to a relatively small macro-

economic shock, that brought on first the Great Recession and 
then  an  anemic  recovery,  weighed  very  heavily  in  the  negative 
in the balance. And this poor performance had been purchased 
at the price of a strengthening and intensification of income and 
wealth inequality.

People noticed. But this did not produce, among global-north 
electorates, solid, long-lasting majorities for politicians to the left 
of left-neoliberalism, who wanted to soften and possibly reverse 
at least parts of the neoliberal turn. Instead, voters increasingly 
began looking for somebody to blame, and for some leader who 
would punish whoever the scapegoats turned out to be. Plus, the 
United States was no longer leading. The politics of opposition 
had transformed itself into an agenda where job number one was 
to make the president of the opposing party a failure. “What are 
you in America going to do to fix your broken system?” senior 
Chinese Communist Party cadre and IMF deputy managing di-
rector Min Zhu asked me in 2015. I had no answer.

As I noted early in Chapter 15, the time since the beginning 
of the neoliberal turn overlaps my career, and so memories of my 
personal engagement alternately sharpen and blur my judgment. 
I have a hard time believing that I can even approach the histo-
rian’s  ideal  of  telling  the  narratives  wie  es  eigentlich  gewesen,  as 
they essentially came to pass, or viewing things sine ira et studio, 
without anger or bias, seeing and understanding rather than ad-
vocating and judging.40

The way to bet, however, is that I personally cannot but over-
estimate the degree to which bad luck and bad choices by power-
ful and crucial individuals produced the rather sorry state of the 
global north as of 2010.

I do now think that bad luck and bad choices—hanging chads 
in ballots in Florida voting machines in 2000, George H.W. Bush 
giving the astonishingly unqualified-for-the-job George W. Bush 
his Rolodex and his full support, and what followed that—plus 
the weaknesses and errors of neoliberalism that cracked the system

from  2000  to  2007.  I  do  now  think  that  things  were  so  badly 
cracked as of 2007 that the shattering of the system by 2010 was 
likely,  if  not  inevitable.  With  skill  and  luck,  could  things  have 
been glued back together? In the United States, the Obama ad-
ministration, the leaders of the Republican Party, and the Amer-
ican people were not up to the job, as 2016 showed. In Western 
Europe things were worse.

But others see not contingency, but necessity. They see not 
choice, but structure, in what I call the end of the long twentieth 
century. They agree that the years after 2000 saw the end of the 
era  in  which  what  we  call  the  global  north,  and  especially  the 
United  States,  were—in  a  more  good  than  bad  way—the  fur-
naces where the future was being forged.

And I also think that future historians’ judgment will proba-

bly be in accord with theirs, rather than mine.

CONCLUSION

Are We Still Slouching  

Towards Utopia?

I n 1870 a major shift took place for humanity. With the com-

ing  of  the  industrial  research  lab,  the  modern  corporation, 
and truly cheap ocean and land transport and communication, 
we  went  from  a  world  in  which  economic  patterns  formed  a 
semi-stable backdrop of grinding mass poverty to one where the 
economy was constantly revolutionizing itself, entering into states 
of increasing prosperity via the discovery, development, and de-
ployment  of  new  technologies.  This  Schumpeterian  process  of 
creative  destruction  doubled  humanity’s  potential  productive 
power  in  each  generation.  And  in  the  years  that  followed,  the 
foundations and underpinnings of society were repeatedly shaken 
and fractured. Long centuries like the one from 1870 to 2010 
are, obviously, made up of many, many moments. The twenti-
eth century’s important moments were set in motion by this cre-
ative destruction and the corresponding shaking and fracturing. 
Here are two moments I see as important. Both come from about  
the long twentieth century’s midpoint:

The  first  moment  occurred  in  1930  when  John  Maynard 
Keynes gave his speech “Economic Possibilities for Our Grand-
children”  (quoted  in  Chapter  7),  in  which  he  concluded  that

economic problems were not humanity’s most “permanent prob-
lem,” but that instead, once our economic problems were solved, 
the real difficulty would be “how to use . . . freedom from press-
ing  economic  cares . . . to  live  wisely  and  agreeably  and  well.” 
I  will  address  the  significance  of  these  comments  later  in  this 
conclusion.

The  second  important  moment  was  nearly  contemporane-
ous.  It  was  when  Franklin  Delano  Roosevelt  took  hold  of  the 
US government, broke the gridlock in US politics, and started 
to experiment with ways to solve the economic problem of the 
Great Depression.

The day after his inauguration in March 1933, FDR forbade 
the export of gold and declared a bank holiday. Within four days 
the House and Senate had convened, and the House unanimously 
passed Roosevelt’s first bill, a banking reform bill called the Emer-
gency  Banking  Act,  that  arranged  for  the  reopening  of  solvent 
banks,  as  well  as  the  reorganization  of  other  banks,  and  gave 
Roosevelt  complete  control  over  gold  movements.  The  second 
bill  Roosevelt  submitted  to  Congress  also  passed  immediately. 
It was the Economy Act, cutting federal spending and bringing 
the budget closer to balance. The third was the Beer and Wine 
Revenue Act, a precursor to an end to Prohibition—the repeal 
of the constitutional amendment banning the sale of alcohol. On 
March  29  he  called  on  Congress  to  regulate  financial  markets.  
On  March  30  Congress  established  Roosevelt’s  Civilian  Con-
servation Corps. On April 19 Roosevelt took the United States 
off  of  the  gold  standard.  On  May  12  Congress  passed  Roo-
sevelt’s  Agricultural  Adjustment  Act.  On  May  18  Roosevelt 
signed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act creating the first large 
government- owned utility corporation in the United States. Also 
on May 18, he submitted to Congress the centerpiece of his first 
hundred days: the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). All 
factions within the newly constituted administration won some-
thing in the legislation: Businesses won the ability to collude—

to draft “codes of conduct” that would make it easy to maintain 
relatively  high  prices,  and  to  “plan”  to  match  capacity  to  de-
mand.  Socialist- leaning  planners  won  the  requirement  that  the 
government—through  the  National  Recovery  Administration 
(NRA)—approve the industry-drafted plans. Labor won the right 
to  collective  bargaining  and  the  right  to  have  minimum  wages 
and maximum hours incorporated into the industry-level plans. 
Spenders won some $3.3 billion in public works.

And  so  the  First  New  Deal  entailed  a  strong  “corporatist” 
program of joint government-industry planning, collusive regu-
lation, and cooperation; strong regulation of commodity prices 
for the farm sector and other permanent federal benefits; a pro-
gram of building and operating utilities; huge amounts of other 
public works spending; meaningful federal regulation of finan-
cial markets; insurance for small depositors’ bank deposits along 
with mortgage relief and unemployment relief; a commitment to 
lower working hours and raise wages (resulting in the National 
Labor Relations Act of 1935, or Wagner Act); and a promise to 
lower tariffs (fulfilled in the Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1935).

The NIRA, plus the devaluation of the dollar, did break the 
back of expectations of future deflation. The creation of deposit 
insurance and the reform of the banking system did make savers 
willing  to  trust  their  money  to  the  banks  again  and  began  the 
re-expansion of the money supply. Corporatism and farm subsi-
dies did spread the pain. Taking budget balance off the agenda 
helped.  Promising  unemployment  and  mortgage  relief  helped. 
Promising public works spending helped. All these policy moves 
kept things from getting worse. They certainly made things some-
what better immediately and substantially better soon thereafter.
But aside from devaluation, monetary expansion, an end to 
expectations of deflation, and an end to pressure for more fiscal 
contraction, what was the effect of the rest of Roosevelt’s “first 
one hundred days”? It is not clear whether the balance sheet of the 
rest of that period is positive or negative. A full-fledged policy of

monetary inflation and mammoth fiscal deficits that might have 
pulled the country out of the Great Depression quickly—that did 
pull Hitler’s Germany out of the Great Depression quickly—was 
not really tried. Consumers complained that the National Recov-
ery Administration raised prices. Workers complained that it gave 
them insufficient voice. Businessmen complained that the gov-
ernment was telling them what to do. Progressives complained 
that  the  NRA  created  monopoly.  Spenders  worried  that  collu-
sion among businesses raised prices, reduced production, and in-
creased unemployment. Hoover and his ilk declared that if FDR 
had only done as Hoover had been doing, everything would have 
been better sooner.

In  the  face  of  such  criticism  Roosevelt  kept  trying  differ-
ent things. If business-labor-government “corporatism” did not 
work—and  was  blocked  by  the  mostly  Republican-appointed  
Supreme Court—perhaps a safety net would. The most enduring 
and  powerful  accomplishment  of  the  New  Deal  was  to  be  the 
Social Security Act of 1935, which provided federal cash assis-
tance for widows, orphans, children without fathers in the home, 
and the disabled and established a near-universal system of fed-
erally funded old-age pensions. If pushing up the dollar price of 
gold did not work well enough, perhaps strengthening the union 
movement would: the Wagner Act set down a new set of rules for 
labor-management  conflict  and  strengthened  the  union  move-
ment, paving the way for a wave of unionization in the United 
States that survived for half a century. Massive public works and 
public employment programs restored some self-esteem to work-
ers and transferred money to households without private-sector 
jobs—but  at  the  probable  price  of  some  delay  in  recovery,  as 
firms and workers saw higher taxes.

Other policies were tried: Antitrust policy and the breaking- 
 up of utility monopolies. A more progressive income tax. A hes-
itant  embrace  of  deficit  spending—not  just  as  an  unavoidable 
temporary evil but as a positive good. As the decade came to an

end, Roosevelt’s concerns necessarily shifted to the forthcoming 
war in Europe and to the Japanese invasion of China. Dr. New 
Deal was replaced by Dr. Win the War. In the end the programs 
of  the  Second  New  Deal  probably  did  little  to  cure  the  Great 
Depression in the United States.1 But they did turn the United 
States into a modest European-style social democracy.

Much followed of consequence. That Franklin Roosevelt was 
center-left rather than center-right, that the length of the Great 
Depression meant that institutions were shaped by it in a durable 
sense, and that the United States was the world’s rising super-
power, and the only major power not crippled to some degree 
by World War II—all these factors made a huge difference. After 
World War II, it had the power and the will to shape the world 
outside the Iron Curtain. It did so. And that meant the world 
was to be reshaped in a New Deal rather than a reactionary or 
fascist mode.

Keynes  and  Roosevelt  are  useful  reminders  that  the  fact  of 
individuals acting in particular ways at precise moments, not just 
thinking thoughts but finding themselves with opportunities to 
make  those  thoughts  influential,  matters  profoundly.  Even  in 
grand narratives.

MANY—MOST PROMINENTLY British communist historian Eric 
Hobsbawm2—take  Lenin’s  Bolshevik  coup  and  Stalin’s  sub-
sequent  construction  of  really-existing  socialism  as  the  axis  on 
which twentieth-century history turns. Under this interpretation, 
the main thread of twentieth-century history covers the period 
1917–1990  and  recounts  the  three-cornered  struggle  of  liberal 
quasi-democratic  capitalism,  fascism,  and  really-existing  social-
ism.  Perhaps  this  story  is  an  epic:  the  good  guys  win.  But  for 
Hobsbawm, this story is tragic: really-existing socialism was hu-
manity’s last best hope; though crippled by the circumstances of 
its  birth,  still  it  grew  strong  enough  to  rescue  the  world  from

fascism,  but  then  it  decayed,  and  its  dissolution  closed  off  the 
true  road  to  a  socialist  utopia.  In  short,  the  bad—but  not  the 
worst—guys win.

I do not take this view.
In some sense, I am more optimistic. I see the build-out of 
technology and organization and the development of better ways 
to manage modern economies as more important things to fo-
cus on than faction fights within the post-1917 Kremlin. But as 
nearly everyone in the world today is keenly aware, the struggle 
for human liberty and prosperity has not been decisively and per-
manently won.

Thus I see the history of the long twentieth century as pri-
marily  the  history  of  four  things—technology-fueled  growth, 
globalization, an exceptional America, and confidence that hu-
manity could at least slouch toward utopia as governments solved 
political-economic problems. And even that slouch was going to 
be done at uneven, unequal, and unfair rates, depending on skin 
tone and gender. Still, twice in that long century, 1870–1914 and 
1945–1975, something every preceding generation would have 
called  near-utopia  came  nearer,  rapidly.  But  these  generation- 
long episodes of economic El Dorados were not sustained. Indi-
viduals, ideas, and opportunities help explain why.

Before 1870, only wild optimists had any confidence that hu-
manity might have a path to utopia—and even for them, the path 
was a rugged road requiring massive transformations of human 
society and psychology.

One such utopian was Karl Marx. He and his close associate 
Friedrich Engels, writing in 1848, theorized that they were in the 
midst of what they called the bourgeois epoch—a time when pri-
vate property and market exchange served as fundamental orga-
nizing principles in human society, creating powerful incentives 
for  scientific  research  and  engineering  development,  and  spur-
ring business investment to deploy marvels of technology to am-
plify human productivity beyond previous imaginings. Marx and

Engels saw the interrelated phenomena that defined this bour-
geois epoch as both Redeemer and Satan. They were Redeemer 
insofar as they created the possibility of a wealthy society in which 
people could, cooperatively, do what they wanted to live full lives. 
But at the same time, their Satanic workings kept impoverished 
and  even  further  impoverished  the  overwhelming  majority  of 
humanity, and would in the end force them into a more bitter 
state of slavery than before. For Marx the path to utopia required 
the descent of humanity into an Industrial Inferno, for only that 
could trigger it to call forth the descent from Heaven of a New 
Jerusalem, in the form of a communist revolution and the total 
overthrow of the existing order of society. But to believe that that 
path was there, and that humanity was certain to walk it—that 
required  great  confidence  that  things  hoped  for  had  solid  sub-
stance, and that things not seen were truly in evidence.3

Another  relative  optimist,  John  Stuart  Mill,  anticipated  a 
lesser utopia that would require less of an overthrow. Mill was 
an ardent believer in freedom, individual initiative, science, and 
technology—but  he  was  also  deeply  fearful  of  the  Malthusian 
dilemma. The inventions of science and the deployment of tech-
nology would create fortunes for the rich and expand the num-
bers of comforts of the middle class, but the great majority of 
humanity would remain working class and continue to live lives 
of drudgery and imprisonment. Mill saw only one out: govern-
ment would have to control human fertility via mandatory birth 
control.4 Then all could be well.

But  Marx’s  and  Mill’s  rather  odd  optimisms  made  them 
somewhat outliers in their day, not in that their optimisms were 
odd but in that they were optimistic at all. Back in 1870, there 
was great reason to doubt that social equality, individual liberty, 
political democracy, and general, let alone abundant, prosperity 
lay  in  humanity’s  future.  The  United  States  had  just  narrowly 
survived a bloody civil war that had killed 750,000 men, one-
twelfth of its adult white male population. Typical standards of

living were still gravely impoverished. Most people were stunted, 
by our standards, and often hungry and illiterate.

Did Marx and Mill see the trends of their day more clearly 
than others? Or were they simply lucky in seeing something of the 
magnitude of forthcoming material wealth and the possibilities 
that material wealth might deliver for humanity? Humanity had 
been shaking the portcullis before 1870. And in 1870 a few major 
changes  broke  the  lock.  The  coming  of  the  industrial  research 
lab, of the modern corporation, and of globalization opened up, 
for the first time in human history, the opportunity to solve our 
problems of material want. Moreover, at that moment, humanity 
was  lucky  enough  to  have  an  about-to-be-global  market  econ-
omy.  As  the  genius  Friedrich  von  Hayek  keenly  observed,  the 
market economy crowdsources—incentivizes and coordinates—
solutions to the problems that it sets itself. After 1870 it could 
solve the problem of providing those with control over valuable 
property resources with an abundance of the necessities, conve-
niences, and luxuries they wanted and believed they needed.

Thus the trail to human material abundance, and to utopia, 
became visible and walkable—or runnable. And everything else 
should have followed from that. Much has. By 1914 the prevail-
ing pessimism of 1870 appeared old-fashioned, if not completely 
wrong. The intervening years had truly been, for the world, an 
extraordinary  episode  in  the  economic  progress  of  humanity. 
And there was every reason to think it would continue: it seemed 
we could look forward to a genuine utopia of abundance, a future 
in which further scientific discoveries would be developed in the 
world’s industrial research laboratories, and then spread world-
wide into the globalized economy by modern corporations.

But then World War I came. And afterward it was clear that 
what the optimistic had regarded as aberrant and scandalous was 
the rule, and that deep trouble could not be avoided. People were 
not satisfied with what the market economy offered them. Gov-
ernments  proved  incapable  of  managing  economies  to  preserve

stability and guarantee year-to-year growth. Sometimes popula-
tions with democracy threw it away to authoritarian demagogues. 
Other  times,  the  rich  and  the  top  military  professionals  of  the 
world decided that domination was in fact worth trying. Tech-
nology  and  organization  enabled  tyrannies  of  unprecedented 
magnitude, and economic disparities—both between and within 
countries—grew and grew. The demographic transition to low fer-
tility and low population growth was rapid, but not rapid enough 
to prevent the twentieth-century population explosion, with its 
additional stresses on and transformations of societal order.

Throughout this process, the global south was falling further 
and further behind—growing, on average, but not catching up, 
as decade upon decade saw it with less manufacturing and thus 
less in relative terms of an engineering and science community 
on which to build up its economy’s productive-knowledge stock. 
Outside of two charmed circles—the group of Marshall Plan aid 
recipients,  and  those  clinging  to  the  Pacific  Rim  of  Asia—the 
global south did not even begin to right itself, in the sense of start-
ing to grow faster than the global north, and so even taking the 
first step toward catching up, rather than falling further behind, 
until more than a decade after the 1979 neoliberal turn. Those 
that did worst were those unlucky enough to be ensorcelled by 
the spell of Lenin, and thus took the really-existing socialist road 
from 1917 to 1990.

The  global  north  was  lucky  enough  to  re-find  after  World 
War II what it thought was the path to utopia. The pace of eco-
nomic  growth  during  the  Thirty  Glorious  Years  that  followed 
made, by its end in the 1970s, people dizzy with success: expect-
ing more, and tremendously upset at what seem in retrospect to 
be relatively minor speedbumps and roadblocks. But mere rapid 
growth did not satisfy those of a right-wing temperament, who 
felt that a prosperity that was shared too equally was unfair, and 
degrading. And mere rapid growth did not satisfy those of a left-
wing temperament, either, for they felt that the problems that the

market, even tweaked and managed by social democrats, solved 
did not produce even a partial version of the utopia they sought. 
And so the world took its neoliberal turn. But the neoliberal pol-
icy prescriptions did not produce a slouching toward utopia that 
was more rapid in any sense.

From 1870 to 2010 was 140 years. Who back in 1870, poor 
as humanity was then, would have thought that by 2010 human-
ity would have the ability to provide each person with more ma-
terial resources than could have been imagined in 1870? And who 
would have thought that with those resources humanity would 
be unable to use them to build a close approximation to a true 
utopia?

Recall that, back at the beginning of this book and of the long 
twentieth century, Edward Bellamy had thought that the power 
to dial up any one of four live orchestras and put it on the speaker-
phone would carry us to “the limit of human felicity.” There was 
only one person in Britain in the early 1600s who could watch a 
theatrical entertainment about witches in his home: King James 
I—and that was only if Shakespeare and company currently had 
Macbeth in repertory. There was one thing that Nathan Mayer 
Rothschild, the richest man in the first half of the 1800s, wanted 
in 1836: a dose of antibiotics, so that he would not die in his 
fifties of an infected abscess. Today we not only can produce the 
sorts of things that were produced in 1870 with remarkably less 
human effort, but can easily produce conveniences (that we now 
regard as necessities), former luxuries (that we now regard as con-
veniences), and things that previously could not have been pro-
duced at any price. Does saying that we are more than ten times 
richer than our 1870 predecessors really capture that sea-change 
in a satisfactory way?

Yet we found as of 2010 that we had not run to the utopian 
trail’s end. Moreover, for us the end of the utopian trail was no 
longer visible, even if we had previously thought that it was.

Driving it all, always in the background and often in the fore-
ground, were the industrial research labs discovering and devel-
oping  things,  the  large  corporations  developing  and  deploying 
them,  and  the  globalized  market  economy  coordinating  it  all. 
But in some ways the market economy was more problem than 
solution. It recognized only property rights, and people wanted 
Polanyian rights: rights to a community that gave them support, 
to an income that gave them the resources they deserved, and to 
economic stability that gave them consistent work. And for all the 
economic progress that was achieved during the long twentieth 
century, its history teaches us that material wealth is of limited 
use in building utopia. It is an essential prerequisite, but far from 
sufficient. And this is where Keynes’s comment about the most 
permanent problem being how “to live wisely and agreeably and 
well” comes in once again. His speech was an important moment 
because  he  perfectly  expressed  what  the  essential  difficulty  has 
proved to be.

Of the four freedoms that Franklin Roosevelt thought ought 
to be every person’s birthright—freedom of speech, freedom of 
worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear5—only free-
dom from want is secured by material wealth. The others remain 
to be secured by other means. What the market taketh and giveth 
can, and often is, overshadowed by hopes and fears arising out of 
other wants and needs.

The shotgun marriage of Friedrich von Hayek and Karl Pol-
anyi,  blessed  by  John  Maynard  Keynes,  that  helped  raise  the 
post–World War II North Atlantic developmental social democ-
racy was as good as we have so far gotten. But it failed its own sus-
tainability test, partly because a single generation of rapid growth 
raised the bar high, and partly because Polanyian rights required 
stability, the treating of equals equally, and the treating of per-
ceived  unequals  unequally  in  ways  that  neither  the  Hayekian- 
Schumpeterian market economy of creative destruction nor the

Polanyian social democratic society of universal egalitarian social 
insurance rights could ever deliver.

In the decades around 2000, there were four developments 
that together brought to an end the time span of the long twenti-
eth century, and that together might mark the end of humanity’s 
time slouching toward utopia. The first came in 1990, when the 
highly innovative and productive industries of Germany and Ja-
pan successfully challenged the United States’ technological edge, 
undermining  the  underpinnings  of  American  exceptionalism. 
The second was 2001, when forms of fanatic religious violence 
that we all thought had been in retreat for centuries flamed up 
again, and pundits scratched their chins and opined about a “war 
of civilizations”—but there was no such thing. The third was the 
Great Recession, which began in 2008, when it became clear that 
we had forgotten the Keynesian lessons of the 1930s, and lacked 
either  the  capacity  or  the  will  to  do  what  was  necessary.  The 
fourth  was  the  world’s  failure  during  the  period  from  roughly 
1989 (when the science became clear) to the present to act de-
cisively to combat global warming. History after the confluence 
of these events looks notably distinct from history before, as if it 
requires a new and different grand narrative to make sense of it.

That the long twentieth century was over by 2010 and would 
not be revivified was confirmed by the rupture that came next, on 
November 8, 2016, when Donald Trump won that year’s presi-
dential election. In that moment, it became clear that each of the 
four defining developments of the long twentieth century could 
not  be  restored.  Economic  growth  in  the  North  Atlantic  had 
slipped substantially—if not all the way to the pre-1870 slower 
pace, a substantial part of the way. Globalization was definitely in 
reverse: it had few public advocates, and many enemies.

Plus, people elsewhere—rightly—no longer saw the United 
States  as  an  exceptional  country,  or  the  US  government  as  a 
trustworthy  leader  on  the  world  stage.  Those  judgments  were 
massively  strengthened  when  more  than  the  counted  345,323

Americans died in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 alone, as 
the only virus-containment reaction the Trump administration 
could muster was to spin in circles and whisper sotto voce that the 
deaths weren’t their fault, for how could they have been expected 
to anticipate an unleashed Chinese bioweapon? Science and tech-
nology  produced  marvels  in  terms  of  the  extremely  rapid  and 
successful development of powerful vaccines. US-led global gov-
ernance, however, proved inept by failing to vaccinate the world 
before the pandemic spread widely and developed new variants.

In addition, confidence in the future was also, if not gone, 
greatly attenuated. The threat of global warming was the Devil 
of Malthus taking, if not yet flesh, at least a form of shadow. The 
only place where confidence in the future was strong was among 
the cadres of the Chinese Communist Party, who saw themselves 
leading humanity forward holding high the banner of Socialism 
with Chinese Characteristics and guided by Mao Zedong–Deng 
Xiaoping–Xi  Jinping  Thought.  But  to  all  outside,  that  seemed 
more like corrupt authoritarian state surveillance capitalism with 
Chinese characteristics (although paying lip service, and perhaps 
someday more, to egalitarian-utopian “common prosperity” aspi-
rations). So China’s ascendance seemed to outsiders unlikely to 
promise forward steps on the path to utopia. Instead, it seemed 
to signal a return—albeit at a much higher level of general pros-
perity—to history’s Wheel of Fortune, to a cycle of rulers and 
ruled, the strong grabbing what they wished and the weak suffer-
ing what they must.

To the extent that the Trump administration had a worldview, 
it was one of suspicion, premised on the idea that internal and 
external enemies, especially nonwhite and non-English-speaking 
people,  were  taking  advantage  of  America’s  values  of  freedom 
and  opportunity.  To  the  extent  that  there  were  policies,  they 
consisted of, first and most of all, tax cuts for the rich. Second, 
there was climate change denial. Third, there were random reg-
ulatory rollbacks, largely uninformed by technocratic calculation

of  benefits  and  costs.  And,  behind  everything,  cruelty—which 
often seemed to be the sole point.6 And then there were raving 
denunciations of the administration’s own public health officials 
(whom  he  nevertheless  did  not  seek  to  replace:  “But  Fauci’s  a 
disaster.  If  I  listened  to  him  we’d  have  500,000  deaths”;  “Dr. 
Fauci and Dr. Birx . . . [are] self-promoters trying to reinvent his-
tory to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations, 
which I fortunately almost always overturned”; and—after a rally 
crowd chanted “Fire Fauci!”—“Don’t tell anybody, but let me 
wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice, I 
appreciate it!”7 The plague was, in the end, to kill more than 1 
million Americans, spreading across the country during the last 
year of his presidency in 2020 and concentrated in regions where 
local election-winning politicians pledged allegiance to Donald 
Trump thereafter. It killed only one-fourth as large a fraction of 
the population in Canada.

With the 2016 presidential election, even as Americans di-
vided into two opposing camps that agreed on virtually nothing, 
nearly everyone shared a sense that the nation was in big trouble. 
Depending on who you asked, Donald Trump was either a symp-
tom of this decline or its only potential “Flight 93” cure.8 Either 
case saw a transformation to a very different America. Either it 
had already happened, and had brought the story of American 
exceptionalism to an end, or it was necessary to make an Amer-
ica that had lost its compass great again. And the United States 
was not alone in its unhappy circumstances. Both America and 
the world faced a constellation of new and worsening problems 
that seemed certain to challenge, and perhaps to threaten, civili-
zation’s many accomplishments over the course of the long twen-
tieth century.

President Trump did not just put a period to the long twenti-
eth century’s exhaustion but served as a reminder that pessimism, 
fear, and panic can animate individuals, ideas, and events as read-
ily as optimism, hope, and confidence.

What went wrong? Well, Hayek and his followers were not 
only Dr. Jekyll–side geniuses but also Mr. Hyde–side idiots. They 
thought the market could do the whole job, and commanded hu-
manity to believe in “the market giveth, the market taketh away; 
blessed be the name of the market.” But humanity objected: the 
market manifestly did not do the job, and the job that the market 
economy did do was rejected, and marked “return to sender.”

So  others—including  Karl  Polanyi,  Theodore  Roosevelt, 
John Maynard Keynes, Benito Mussolini, Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt, Vladimir Lenin, and Margaret Thatcher—tried to think 
up satisfactory solutions. They dissented from “the market giveth 
. . .” constructively and destructively, demanding that the mar-
ket  do  less,  or  do  something  different,  and  that  other  institu-
tions do more. Perhaps the closest humanity got to a successful 
“something  different”  was  the  shotgun  marriage  of  Hayek  and 
Polanyi, blessed by Keynes, in the form of post–World War II 
global north developmental-state social democracy. But that so-
cial democratic institutional setup had failed its own sustainabil-
ity  test.  And  while  subsequent  neoliberalism  fulfilled  many  of  
the promises it had made to the global-north elite, it was in no 
wise progress toward any desirable utopia.

Thus the world found itself in a position analogous to the 
one that John Maynard Keynes had described in 1924, when he 
critiqued Leon Trotsky’s assumption “that the moral and intel-
lectual problems of the transformation of society have already 
been solved—that a plan exists, and that nothing remains ex-
cept to put it into operation.” Because, Keynes said, this was not 
true: “We lack more than usual a coherent scheme of progress, a 
tangible ideal. All the political parties alike have their origins in 
past ideas and not in new ideas—and none more conspicuously 
so than the Marxists. It is not necessary to debate the subtleties 
of  what  justifies  a  man  in  promoting  his  gospel  by  force;  for  
no one has a gospel. The next move is with the head, and fists 
must wait.”9

Economic improvement, attained by slouch or gallop, mat-
ters. The attainment of more than enough—more than enough 
calories,  shelter,  clothing,  material  goods—matters.  Once  at-
tained, even pessimists are reluctant to give them up. And certain 
thoughts,  once  thought,  are  hard  to  forget.  This  is  an  unsung 
benefit of the quantitative index of the global value of useful hu-
man knowledge. It compounds. Among these thoughts are “the 
market giveth, the market taketh; blessed be the name of the mar-
ket”; and, equally, “the market is made for man, not man for the 
market”;  and  also,  I  would  add:  because  often  demand  creates 
supply, governments must manage, and manage competently, at 
times with a heavy touch.

Humans’ ideas and visions of utopia have been widely dispa-
rate: the Holy Kingdom of the Heavens brought down to earth; 
the  harmonious  and  natural  leisured  life  of  Arcadia;  the  luxu-
rious  sensual  pleasures  and  ecstasies  of  Sybaris;  the  disciplined 
excellence of Sparta; the cacophonous and free speech and action 
of Athens; the collective purpose and good order of Rome and 
its Pax. Material scarcity, it was largely agreed, kept and would 
keep  those  (except  for  the  theological  ones)  out  of  humanity’s 
permanent grasp. The golden age was almost always seen as in 
the  past,  or  at  least  in  some  distant  and  at  least  semi-mythical 
elsewhere, where resources were much more abundant, not in any 
likely future.10

It was in 1870 that things began to change. As early as 1919, 
Keynes had emphasized that humanity had already attained the 
power  to  produce  “conveniences,  comforts,  and  amenities  be-
yond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of 
other ages,” even though the enjoyment of such was still confined 
to an upper class.11 Aristotle in 350 BCE had his asides about how 
it was fantasy to imagine that the authority of masters and the 
bondage  of  slaves  could  be  superseded,  for  that  would  require 
humans to have the godlike powers to make and then command 
servitors—the robot blacksmiths of Daidalos and the self-aware,

self-propelled serving vessels that Hephaistos made for the gods’ 
banquets  on  Mount  Olympos.12  We  humans  had,  as  of  2010, 
wildly outstripped their dreams and imaginings.

Is there anybody in any previous century who would not be 
amazed and incredulous at seeing humanity’s technological and 
organizational powers as of 2010? Yet they would then go on to 
the next question: Why, with such godlike powers to command 
nature and organize ourselves, have we done so little to build a 
truly human world, to approach within sight of any of our utopias?
By 2010 distrust in America’s hegemonic role had been ce-
mented by Middle Eastern misadventures. Discontent had grown 
with exploding income and wealth inequality that few associated 
with  any  boost  to  economic  growth.  The  Great  Recession  of 
2008–2010 had revealed the emptiness of claims that the neo-
liberal technocrats had finally gotten the problems of economic 
management right. The political institutions of the global north 
did not even begin to grapple with the problem of global warm-
ing. The underlying engine of productivity growth had begun to 
stall. And the great and good of the global north were about to 
fail to prioritize a rapid restoration of full employment, and to fail 
to understand and manage the discontents that would bring neo-
fascist and fascist-adjacent politicians to prominence worldwide 
in the 2010s.

Thus the long twentieth century’s story was over.
Perhaps it did not have to end then, in 2010. Perhaps the 
bright  future  that  many  had  envisioned  during  the  Clinton 
administration— the idea that if its policies could be continued, 
they  would  start  to  work  to  restore  rapid  equitable  growth  as 
the  information-technology  boom  roared  ahead—was  always 
illusory. Or perhaps the opportunity could have been grasped, 
had chance and contingency turned out otherwise. Perhaps if in 
2008 the United States had elected an FDR, he (or she) could 
have worked a miracle—as the original FDR had unexpectedly  
done in 1933 and after. Perhaps even in 2016 the dry bones of the

long twentieth century’s pattern of rapid productivity growth, 
governments that could manage the creative- destruction trans-
formations that such growth brought to the world, and Ameri-
can exceptionalism could have been made to live again.

But it turned out that post-2010 America would instead elect 
Donald Trump, and Western Europe would do little better, end-
ing possibilities of revivification.

A new story, which needs a new grand narrative that we do 

not yet know, has begun.

MY  DEBTS  IN  WRITING  THIS  BOOK  ARE  VAST:  MY  WIFE,  ANN 
Marie Marciarille, and children, Michael and Gianna, have made 
the long process of writing it a very joyous one. My development 
editor, Thomas Lebien, and my editor at Basic, Brian Distelberg, 
have been essential: much of this book might be better framed 
as a Platonic dialogue with them, and it would not exist without 
them. My intellectual debts are so great, and there are very many 
who deserve to be thanked (without implicating any of them in 
the  many,  many  mistakes  I  am  sure  I  have  committed  in  this 
book). But let me cheat and thank only ten more: First of all, 
let  me  thank  Andrei  Shleifer  and  Larry  Summers:  whenever  I 
have been able to think thoughts worth recording and dissemi-
nating, more often than not my train of thought has begun with 
“What  would  Larry  say  here?,”  or  “What  would  Andrei  think 
about this?” Then there is the huge amount of my intellectual 
formation that springs from the Committee on Degrees in Social 
Studies,  most  importantly  Jeff  Weintraub  and  Shannon  Stim-
son. The senior faculty of the Harvard Economic History semi-
nar must also belong: Peter Temin, Jeffrey Williamson, Claudia 
Goldin, and the late David Landes. Paul Krugman has been an

immense influence, albeit mostly at a distance: the person who 
I  think  comes  closest  to  wearing  the  mantle  of  John  Maynard 
Keynes in our generation. For the tenth, let me cheat again: my 
colleagues at the University of California at Berkeley, the finest 
collection of colleagues collected anywhere in economics at the 
end of the twentieth century, and—collectively, for the whole is 
much greater than the sum of its parts—the best teachers I can 
imagine. And to all those I have not mentioned, be assured that 
I try hard to remember my intellectual debts, and to at least pay 
them forward.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT NOTES:

I have limited the endnotes in this volume to direct quo-
tations,  close  paraphrases,  markers  for  where  my  thought  and 
knowledge  has  been  predominantly  shaped  by  a  single  source, 
and places where I think a reference for “what to read next to go 
more deeply” is appropriate.

I  have  done  so  even  though  I  am  well  aware  that  they  are 
grossly  inadequate.  Nearly  every  single  paragraph  needs  to  be 
substantially buttressed, for each certainly could be—and, I hope, 
will be—be fiercely disputed by at least one person of great intelli-
gence and knowledge. Moreover, where I am swimming with (or 
against) a current, I have not dropped a note to any of the people 
who make up that current, save where I think I can recommend 
a best entry point into the literature. And even where I think I 
am original . . . put it this way: Keynes wrote of the madmen in 
authority who thought they were hearing voices in the air when 
actually academic scribblers had insinuated themselves into their 
minds. Machiavelli wrote of how his books were his friends who 
he spoke to, and they answered—as he spun-up from black marks

on  white  pages  sub-Turing  instantiations  of  the  minds  of  the  
authors which he then ran on his wetware. Even where I think 
that  I  am  most  original,  I  am  almost  surely  simply  repeating 
something that my internal model of some wiser person’s mind 
has said to me in my internal dialogue.

So there should for justice’s sake be many more notes. But 
there are stringent limits to how effective lengthy footnotes can 
possibly be. And there are even more stringent limits to how ef-
fective endnotes can be.

So this book also has a supporting- and contradicting- arguments

munist Party of the Soviet Union. But the truth, I think, applies equally well 
to really-existing socialism and its fraternal twin, fascism.

weapon-builder after he came to the United States in 1945, but do mark me 
down as still astonished that there is a Wernher von Braun Center in down-

ing questions” and “presenting data” (see Richard Herrnstein and Charles 
Murray, The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life, 
New York: Simon and Schuster, 1994), which then lead them to assert that 
there are important and fundamental genetically driven racial differences in 
intelligence, should reflect. They should reflect that Charles Murray burned 
a cross to try to terrify the two Black families living in the Midwestern sub-
urb where he grew up—and then has the cheek to claim that “there wouldn’t 
have been a racist thought in our simple-minded minds. That’s how un-
aware  we  were.”  See  Jason  DeParle,  “Daring  Research  or  ‘Social  Science 
Pornography’? Charles Murray,” New York Times, October 9, 1994, https://

should reflect on the sources of their own gullibility, and on the sources of 
their need to believe that Blacks are relatively poor in America today not 
because  of  past  and  present  discrimination  but  because  of  unchangeable 
elements of nature.

Notes to Chapter 13

12. Republican campaign tactician Lee Atwater said back in 1981, in an 
interview with Alexander P. Lamis, that the Republican Party was not a rac-
ist organization because if it were, suppressing the Black vote and reversing 
the Voting Rights Act “would have been a central part of keeping the South 
[electing  Republicans].”  But  now,  he  continued,  “they  don’t  have  to  do 
that. All you gotta do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the  
issues . . . fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cutting taxes—you know 
that old cluster—[and] being tough with national defense.” Atwater was thus 
very hopeful. He may or may not have been right in 1981. But the litmus test 
he proposed strongly suggests that he would be wrong about America’s Re-
publican Party now. Lee Atwater, “Southern Strategy Interview,” 1981, posted 
on YouTube in three parts by “john smith,” August 3, 2013, www.youtube

pling  (because,  trying  to  play  eleven-dimensional  chess,  they  thought  that 
higher oil prices would benefit the United States by giving the Iranian shah, 
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, money with which to purchase weapons and annoy 
the Soviet Union) is something I have never been able to run down satisfac-
torily. Then treasury secretary William Simon thought it was the dominant 
consideration, and a horrible mistake. V. H. Oppenheim, “See the Past: We

Conclusion: Are We Still Slouching  

Towards Utopia?

1. John Maynard Keynes wrote two important letters to Roosevelt in the 
1930s,  both  pleading  for  him  to  be  more  Keynesian:  to  spend  less  energy 
on social democratic structural reform, and more on simply returning to full 
employment. See John Maynard Keynes, “An Open Letter to President Roos-
evelt,” New York Times, December 31, 1933, www.nytimes.com/1933/12/31 
/archives/from-keynes-to-roosevelt-our-recovery-plan-assayed-the-british.

cious, and yet only after utopia had been approached would the resources per 
capita exist to properly educate the working class.

J.  BRADFORD  DELONG  is 
a professor of economics at 
the University of California 
at  Berkeley,  and  a  blogger 
at  the  Washington  Center 
for  Equitable  Growth.  He 
was  born  in  1960  in  Bos-
ton  and  lives  in  Berkeley. 
Google says that he is best 
known,  on  the  Internet  at 
least, for his studies of irrational “noise traders” in financial markets 
and of the shift from the commodity to the information- attention 
economy; for his belief that times of low interest rates are times when 
a large national debt is indeed, in Alexander Hamilton’s words, a na-
tional blessing; and for having worked for the Clinton administration 
as a deputy assistant secretary of the US Treasury. He tries to balance 
himself between economics and history.
